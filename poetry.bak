Abiding In Him

"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever" - Hebrews 13:8

Christ was the Lord of all my yesterdays,
   No matter where I stood:
In sad, in stormy, or in sun-lit ways,
   I found His presence good.

Christ is the Lord of my today:   The dawn
   Beyond my morning hill
Comes up in glory when the night is gone;
   And Christ is with me still.

So I can trust Him for tomorrow too,
   Though skies be dark or fair:
It will not matter — every sky is blue
   When Christ, my Lord, is there.

* A Blackbird Bathes

This strutting, sable bird defies
All old wive's fables: he denies

That black is meant for mourning. See
With what exquisite ecstasy

He savors life: the whole of bliss
To fluff his feathers and dismiss

The dust of earth, beneath this spray.
He dips and ducks and struts away,

To give his wings a furtive flip
And cock his head to watch than drip.

His sombemess is but a guise
Perhaps if we were just as wise

As one small blackbird, we could rift
Our darkness too, and find the gift

From which his satisfaction springs;
The joy that lurks in simple things.

* Above The Clouds

Like Great gray birds of doom above our plane,
The dark clouds threatened, broke in deluge, poured
Against the windows blinding sheets of rain.
The sky was ominous; but still we soared.

And then a sudden miracle of light:
The sun in all its glory, golden, warm;
And, far below, a sea of soft clouds, white
As driven snow. We flew above the storm.

On God's side, all our clouds must look like these.
What seems to us so sinister and grim —
The tears, the tests, the trials and tragedies —
Unfold as something beautiful to Him.

He knows -what wonder waits beyond earth's strife.
Ride high with Him above the storms of life.

A Bride's Song

Your name is proud as lilies white and still,
    Your name is deep as water without sound,
As radiant as sunlight on a hill,
    As secret as the first buds out of ground;

Your name is quietness when trumpets flare,
    Your name is singing when the silence palls.
As cool as curtains blowing in air,
    As soft as elm trees when the first snow falls.

Beloved, you have given me this thing
    That clothes me round with wind and star and dew,
With swift exulting and shy wondering,
    That makes me not myself but part of you—

A strange new creature born of song and flame:
Beloved, you have given me your name!

* Acceptance

One day I thought to ask God, "Why?"
And then I looked into the sky
And saw His steadfast stars ride out
The storm. There was no talk of doubt.

I walked His fields and, underfoot,
I trampled petal, stalk and root.
The only answer to their doom,
From every blossom, was perfume.

A small bird, seeking crumbs in vain,
Fluffed up his feathers in the rain
And lifted up his voice to sing
Without a thought of questioning.

In star, in bloom, in small bird's trill,
I saw acceptance of God's will.
What base presumption then that I
Should dare to ask my Father, "Why?"

A Child Watching Trees

When my Saviour came to me
He was cradled in a tree:
Rough and rude the manger-bed
Where Lord Jesus laid His head;

When my Savious came to die
On a tree they nailed Him high;
This is how my child-thoughts run.
Watching green trees in the sun.

Young trees wear a joy with them:
Do they dream of Bethlehan?
Great trees keep such dignity —
They remember Calvary.

* A Deserted House

Where is the joy, the laughter and the mirth
   That once these walls, now crumbling ruins, held?
Fled, long since fled down scattered ways of earth;
   One with the dust by vagrant winds dispelled.

Where are the feet that trod so lightly here,
   The careless spoken words, the dreams unsaid?
Naught, naught remains of that forgotten cheer;
   Silenced, the halls re-echo to no tread.

What tales of love, of romance, might unfold
   If walls had lips, or windows were not dumb,
We may not know:   they  jealously withhold
   All that has been from those who go and come; —

Save where we find among the rubbish cast
A child's broken toy, to link us with the past.

A Doctor's Prayer

God of the human body, let me be
Only an instrument employed by Thee:
The knowledge and the healing skill are Thine;
The ready hands, the willing heart, are mine.

Before I turn to the appointed task,
Discernment for decision I would ask.
Let me not work alone, unguided, blind:
Touch with Thy wisdom this surrendered mind.

The gift of life, so many hunger for,
Thy hand alone has power to restore.
God the human body, let me be
Only an instrument employed by Thee.

* A Dove At Dawn

Heart of the Dawn, I heard you after sun
   Move through the trees while day was yet unsaid.
Soft stirred the leaves — your brief throbs one by one
   Fell on the ear like griefs uncomforted.

Pathos was there so rare and exquisite
   I marveled. Did lost memories start awake,
Pull at your strings and move across the night,
   That sudden you should rise, and sob, and break?

Heart of the Dawn, I knew you for a bird,
   Gray wing, rose breast — dawn's blended harmonies.
And yet I knew you not. I only heard,
   Out of the shy confusion of the trees,

One white word lift and tremble — spelling love.
Was it yourself O Heart, or God, or Dove?

Adventure

He could not tell what he sought in the wood,
But he kept going on;
Wonder pulled at his sleeve, brushed his coat
And was gone.

Squirrels scuttled up trees, and he stood
Transfixed with desire;
Something tickled his ear with two words —
"Farther, higher".

He could not tell what he wanted to find,
But he kept looking here,
Looking there, until small reaching hands
Closed on fear:

Until coldness crept down through his spine,
And his feet would not stir...........
Now he knew what he longed to embrace —
"Moth-er-ER!"

* Advice For Young Grief

Snap at the green twig, kick at the clod,
   Bury the brown leaf under,
Say, "It is over", laugh at God.
   Will that help much, I Wonder?

There will be other twigs that will grow,
   Clods and brown leaves aplenty:
All that you learn you do not know,
   When you are only twenty.

Eyes on the green twig, cheek on the clod,
   Hands through the brown leaves creeping,
Say, "I am stupid, help me, God" —
   That is the end of weeping.

Afternoon With Patricia: Ambition

My father says, "legitimate",
   "Irregularity",
And "clerical". I hate such words —
   They are too big for me.

My mother says, "Precisely so",
   And "poise" and "womanhood"
I wouldn't want to talk like that —
   Her words sound goody-good.

My sister gurgles, "my heart-throb",
   And "ultra" and "divine";
The words she says are sickly-sweet —
   They wouldn't do for mine.

My brother blurts out "foo-manchoo",
   And "naa" and "goo" and "stuff";
If words like that make sense at all,
   They still don't make enough!

But down beside the fishing wharf,
    With crabs and queer sea-birds,
Lives Uncle Joe (I like him lots)
    And my, he knows the words!

He mends the nets, and winks his eye,
    And nearly lays me flat
With "fan my eyebrows", "blow me down" —
   If I could talk like that!

Afternoon With Patricia: Romance

The nicest man I ever knew
    (You guess him , if you can)
Calls on us twice in every week —
    Yes — it's the garbage-man.

On Wednesdays and on Saturdays
    He drives by and he yells,
"Hello, girls!" Then he carries off
    The most peculiar smells:

The awful things that float to us
    On every passing breeze —
Like orange peel, and sauerkraut,
    And mouldy cottage cheese.

My father is an engineer,
   And Dave says, "Art's the stuff";
But I shall marry the garbage-man
   When I am old enough.

My sister says to choose your man
   For all the gifts he brings —
Like violets, and chocolate creams,
   And furs and diamond rings.

I  wonder if my sister knows
   (She's older and she may) —
But I'm in love with the garbage-man
   For what he takes away!

If I could hold the Book of Life again
   Wherein they say so many wisdoms hide,
Some great inmortal Truth I might retain
   When drifting out on death's eternal tide.

But as a willful child that will not con
   The printed page when pictures may be seen,
So brave I found the beauty of the dawn,
   So  fair the night, I would not read between.

Before my vision page on page -unrolled:
    White noons, December twilights, twisted trees,
Dogwood and violets breaking earth's brown mold,
    Wide burning deserts, and great living seas.

With one short lifetime scant enough to look,
I never read a line in all the book.

* Age Is For Love

Youth is for love, the poets long have sung
   In threadbare words of moon-mist and of dawn:
The great One Flame, lit bravely by the young,
   Flickers with age, burns dimly — and is gone.

They do not know, Beloved, these who make
   A love that runs to music, leaps with light,
Quivers at stars, how struggle and heartbreak
   Have lit a flame that burns on through the night.

Love is for age. When hearts no longer tread
   The dangerous ascent, the deep abyss,
When all that needs audition has been said
   And wonder wakes no longer in a kiss.

Still burns the flame. And two, in time of storm,
Draw up to love — and find it safe and warm.

A Handy Thing

She who dons a wedding ring
Needs this handy little thing:
She can roll and cut and bake,
Things like Mother used to make;

Piecrust will be flakier —
This should make a hit with her.
And, for keeping Dad in line,
Here is something very fine,

Some thing smooth and sleek and trim,
That will make a "hit" with him
When she "konks him on the done" —
If he ever starts to roam.

A Lady Chooses Rost


"Give me the rust", she said, and in her eyes
   There was a look that went beyond the gown
I knew that she was walking with clean skies
   Beyond the noisy confines of the town;

I knew that russet leaves, in drifted heaps,
   Crowded the comers of her mind; that part
Of some lost hope the life defeated keeps
   Was pushing up the windows of her heart.

I knew she was remembering the way
   The country ages, mellowing to rust,
That she had found a dream from yesterday
   And she was nibbling at it, like a crust.
The sales girl wrapped the package and she went.
It was no sale:  It  was a sacrament.

A Legend Of Childhood

God grew so tired of sitting
   Way up in Heaven alone,
He said, "I'll make a new thing,
   Some thing my very own.

The earth that I have fashioned
   By men has been defiled."
And so, to please His fancy,
   God made a little child.

He took a burst of sunshine
   And wrought a golden smile,
Then wrapped it in a little heart
   Simple and free from guile.

Twin stars He stole from Heaven
   To make the shining eyes,
And rosy cheeks were fashioned
   Out where the sunset lies.

A brook came dancing, sparkling,
   He caught its silver note,
And lo! a rippling laugh was heard
   Spilled fran a tiny throat.

And then, because all laughter
   Is sweeter mixed with pain,
He made some tear-drops for his child
   From little drops of rain.

It was a lot of labor;
   But when the little child
Played round the door of Heaven
   God often watched, and smiled.

And Heaven was a different place,
   Till, looking down one day,
He saw a lonely wanan —
   And gave His child away.

Alien

Within the still, white room that gave me birth,
    My body bloomed, the counterpart of two
Who bore me; but alone, across the earth.
   Miles from that place, the heart they never knew

By wise moon fairies on a far high hill
   Was being woven out of threads of mist;
Its fragile beauty was a thing more still
   Than any lake the wind has ever kissed.

And I have borne it secretly within,
   A shy soft wonder sleeping at my breast.
And such has been dissemblance I could win
   That even those who bore me have not guessed,

When misty moonlight blows from tree to tree,
How near they are at last to finding me.

There is suggestion in the up-curved lip

Thou hast an air of being strangely wise,
   As though thy dignity great comfort were,
But there are mocking lights within thine eyes,
   And laughter in thy draperies astir.

Most grave, most still, think not that thou canst blind
   These eyes of mine with wisdoms of the face!

Beneath these robes that play at dignity
Thou hast a heart all youth, all gaiety!

Be not discouraged, though the way seems hard —
   All that is most important yet remains:
Beauty still comes at daybreak to your yard,
   Dressing each comer with exquisite pains;

Color and song, and laughter in the eyes
   Of little children yet too young to know,
Still lend to earth a glint of paradise
   And light the long dark journey here below.

Be not discouraged, though the days of toil
   Yield little increase and the self-denial
Seans hard to bear — gold is a meager spoil;
   And that which is eternally worthwhile,

God from His gracious bounty still lets fall —
Nor asks one single penny for it all.

Toward the earth's awakening —

Not for the newness of the world,
   The spring in tender green,
But for the newness of the heart,
   But for the life washed clean,

But for the glad security
   That hallows all we do,
The knowledge that in Jesus Christ
   Behold, all things are new.

The lonely stars looked down upon
   Three crosses on a hill.

Like furtive forms the shadows moved,
   The earth was wrapped in gloom:
That night the Hope of all the world
   Lay sealed within a tomb.

But on the morrow all was changed,
   Man's grief was joy instead:
The risen Savior walked the world —
   And only Death was dead.

All we like sheep have gone astray, to seek
   The greener pastures and the larger streams;
All we like sheep have wandered, worn and weak,
   To nibble at the fringe of empty dreams.

What depths of desolation and despair
   Would be our lot, if we had never known
The Shepherd's voice, if God had left us there
   To perish in our wanderings, alone!

But not our God, but not our blessed God;
   On Christ was laid the burden of our sin:
The weary way to Calvary He trod,
   And died, that every man might enter in —

To rest by quiet waters, fresh and clean,
To feed where pastures are forever green.

When spring returns to Campbellsville,
And dogwood blooms on College Hill,
In fancy then our spirits too

And when the flaming maples burn.
In autumn dreams we will return,
Recalling hopes as brave and high
As windless ways where wild geese fly.

And every sunset sky will be
Through all the years of manory,
However far our feet may stray,
A glimpse of garnet and of gray.

In praise of you a choicer gift
Than song can be - the gift of youth,
Committed to the Word of Truth.

Leaps in response. What sweet tumultuous art
   That brave, bright note of bubbling bliss betrays.

Above the greening fields, perched on a wire,
   Unconscious of my listening ears below,
He lifts aloft his glad song high and higher
   He lifts my spirit with it - Does he know?

For six brave minutes by the kitchen clock
   By singing beauty is my heart set free,
And then he flies - perhaps to join the flock;
   Night - and the stars - and duty still for me

But weariness slips from me like a husk -
Healed by a song - a meadowlark at dusk.

A Mother's Song For Her Daughter

I cannot tell her all she means to me:
   There is no word that mothers find to say
For love so deep; but I can toil that she
   May have the leisure to be young and gay.

I watch her sometimes and she does not know
   How I am blessing her for all the dear
Abandon of her joy; and how I grow
   In strength and wisdom just be have her near.

A daughter gives herself with out restraint,
   Her youth drops brightest wonder at my feet;
And though I'm selfish sometimes, no complaint
   Of mine shall mar these days she makes complete

I cannot tell her now; but when the years
   Have taught us understanding, then we two
Will find some word — and through a mist of tears
   I'll say, "My daughter, I have lived in you".

Thanks be to God for little lips
   That can be taught to sing

The old, old songs, the tender tunes

That Christ will do what I can not.

And cares. And I knew you as purest joy,

Bowing in grief above some broken toy.
   You came for comfort — I was comforted.

And now I bring my great heartaches to you.
   You wrap me in your love:   remembering

And I, again, am blest — and lifted far
Above the place where any heartaches are.

How like our Lord to add, "and Peter" — knowing
   That one would walk the world in cruel shame,
Forever haunted by a far cock crowing,
   And idle boast, and eyes that held no blame

But looked with brave compassionate reminding
   Into his own. How like our Lord, to know
That somewhere Peter, stumbling on through blinding
   And bitter tears, would need that message so.

That somewhere, Peter, all his spirit broken.
   Past pride, past fear, past all save grim regret,
Would find in two small words a tender token
   That all his lifetime he would not forget:

The sweet assurance that he still belonged,
In spite of all, unto the Lord he wronged.

Andrea Paula, sculptor, carved a heart,
   Carved it of dead dreams and a block of stone.
Grace, beauty, color, dignified his art;
   It all but lived. He worshiped it alone.

But oft at dusk he nursed a secret grief,
   Kneeling before the thing his hands had wrought:
"It will not live," he sobbed. At last belief
   Was crystalized into one frenzied thought:

Andrea Paula while the gray world slept,
   Stole from his breast the heart that was his own,
Crushed it to fragments and on calm knees crept
   Out through the dark and worked it into stone.

They have not, critics say, since time began
Found art so human — nor so cold a man.

His back is bent with weight of care.

Upon his brow and traced their flight

His feeble footsteps beat the earth
   With faulty resonance,
That all too long have traveled down
   The way of circumstance.

His hands are shapeless, trembling things,
   That once were firm and strong,
They speak of weary days of toil
   And duty served too long.

Only within his sunken eyes
   The fire of youth still gleams —
His eyes that all his life have been
   The mirror of his dreams.

"He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night." - John 13:30

And it was night. Not calm, familiar night,
   With hill and star, with darkness cool and kind;
Not these, but total abstinence of light,
   Like sudden midnight caning on the blind:

No drowsy settling of weary wings,
   No light wind shyly fingering the air,
But darkness that was gross, like that which clings
   To doom and desolation and despair.

And it was night. And Judas went alone —
   But how alone, or at what cruel cost
He gave the kiss that made the Savious known.
   He did not dream. Until, too late, too lost,

 He cast his portion on the potter's sod —
 And turned forever from the Son of God.

* "And Redbud Quickens"

All is forgiven now that dogwood blooms
   And redbud quickens on the burnished bough,
And every honeysuckle hedge perfumes
   The countryside. All is forgiven now,

The clean cool curve of furrows freshing turned,
   Young blackbirds strutting sleekly by the plow.
Are harbingers whose meaning we have learned:
   Spring has come back - all is forgiven now.

And what of us who, winter long, have moped
   Beside the fire and let earth's bleakness sift
Into our souls? Now, better than we hoped,
   God gives again His reassuring gift:

Another Spring. Shall we not do our part
And thaw the long, long winter of the heart?

    Anniversary Song
       (To Dad)

Do you remember when our love,
   The little helpless dear one,
Was still so small the whole delight
   Was just to keep it near one?

When every day was holiday,
   In any kind of weather,
Because we nursed our little love
   And tended it together?

The years have seen that love grow up
   To such supreme dimensions
It hardly ever asks for now
   The fond heart's small attentions.

It seldom seeks the boon of arms,
   The hand-clasps and carresses,
This sturdy love we lean upon
   Through failures and successes.

We are so fortunate to have
   This fire to warm December,
This safe and certain flame of love —
   But sometimes I. remember:

Sometimes (I know it's foolish, dear)
   It seems this tall new stranger
Might grow beyond us. Do you think
   There could be any danger?

Another Moment

Another moment, and the earth may loose
   Ten thousand furies bearing us to doom:
A second, even, and without excuse
   Silence of death may fall upon this room —

For it is written men shall not discern
   The final hour when these things must be.
Another moment — and so much to learn,
   A world of wonder still to hear and see!

How fresh is mountain laurel in the spring! —
   I may not see it now, nor hear again
The wild sweet note the Huitacochees sing,
   Nor sense the earth's green odors after rain

But no — the moment passes ... and I stay!
Up! Up! I will drink beauty while I may!

* The Anti-Climax

As two grown tired, we lay aside the volume....
But stay one moment! let us mark the place
Tomorrow brings again the sun to heaven,
The dew to earth — but not your face.

No more together shall we read Love's story;
But haply in the years that are to be,
My idle fingers, turning through the pages,
Shall chance on this — and linger lovingly.

Remembering a romance still unfinished,
A tale whose climax we can never know —
And I shall sigh and "Would it," I shall wonder,
"If we had turned the page, have ended so?"

A Prayer For Love

I pray that Love will find me on a day
   Not too much fretted by the common tasks.
(Lord, thou dost surely know a woman's way
   Of liking to be loved!) My spirit asks

That for this once — if Love should be my lot—
   I may go forth to meet him joyously,
As one on terms with happiness, and not
   Bowed by the daily cares that fall on me.

But if the lighter way be never mine,
   The little, foolish fancies of the heart,
Lord, by thy grace this folly I resign
   So only thou shouldst give me for my part

Though tom by toil the youth that once was I —
If Love should come he will not pass me by

April Assault

Marching over rain-drenched meadows,
Rank on rank they swarm:
Little legions, flower forces,
Take the world by storm.

First confuse the eye with color,
Then with fragrance fret
All the cautious, all the prudent,
All the hard-to-get.

Fiercely move the bright battalions
Under April skies:
Stab with stamens, pelt with petals,
Devastate disguise.

Lost the heart, though well it may be
Wary to a fault —
None can stand before such brilliant
Beautiful assault!

Argonne Forest

All night the rain, in blinding sheets.
Along the war-scarred landscape beats;
Trees rock, and heavy banks of snow
Plunge headlong into pools below;
And mournfully, from dark to light,
The winds go howling through the night.

In Argonne Forest Dead Men walk —
All silently:   They do not talk
Of other days when, side by side,
They fought the noble fight — and died,
But with unseeing eyes they stare
Into the empty night. They beau
No arms to wield against the foe,
But still in solemn ranks they go,
These tattered heroes, — on and on
Through gloomy swamps of old Argonne.

In Argonne Forest, when the spring
Shall smile again, and birds shall sing,
And deep within that Forest's gloom
Light winds shall waft a faint perfume
From hidden flowers, when over all
The dreary landscape light shall fall
And sunshine penetrated the deep
Dark glooms where Dead lien cannot sleep,
The eye shall look in vain for than:
Those tattered hungry forms of men
Will lurk no more, — They will be gone
When Spring shall come to old Argonne.

Only, beside the river there,
The trees shall wear a loftier air.
As though those Souls of wandering men
Had somehow entered into them:
For each shall whisper unto each
The Loving Truths that Dead Men teach.
And when the solitary night
Shall brood o'er Argonne, lo! the light
From many million stars shall keep
A silent watch — where Dead Men sleep.

A Song For Any Father

Strong men survive in steel; the sensitive
   Persist in song and sermon. In his way
Each struggles by accomplishment to live
   Beyond the margin of earth's little day.

But simple men have learned a deeper truth:
   They choose to build in flesh and blood and bone,
And recklessly and proudly squander youth
   To give it to the sons they call their own.

Men choose their monuments. Who builds a boy
   Builds strength and beauty welded into one:
Adventure, humor, everlasting joy,
   And dreams to hold beyond life's setting sun.

Who builds a bridge may serve posterity;
Who builds a boy outwits eternity.

A Spanish Serenade

Softest zephyrs fan my cheek,
As I wander through thy moonlit garden;
Faintly on the breezes home
Comes the sound of sweet guitar and castanets;

Here I linger in thy hour,
Where I've come at dusk to serenade thee;
Love I wait to greet thee,
For thee I love, and thou art mine, Sweetheart!

Chorus:

Come where the wild flowers
Sway in the moonlight,
Whispering of love.

Ah they speak of thee,
Bid thee come to me;

Night is for love, dear,
Love is my life, dear, 
Ah bid me live!

Waken, sweet,
Thy lover greet, 
Or dawn shall break above
A broken heart.

All the voices of the night
Call to wake thee from thy peaceful slumber;
Nightingale breathes forth his song, 
Wildest flood of longing love and melody!

All the air throbs with love's cry,
And I cannot, cannot bear to leave thee;
Love, my heart is breaking,
Oh thou must hear and thou wilt come, Sweetheart!

A Song For Today

Give over dreaming! All too soon the day
   That even now illumes the eastern sky
With blush of morn, will take the twilight way
   And fade in dusk. Up, Heart! forbear the sigh

That trembles for a dream that may not be:
   Behold the promise that this day bestows,
With courage face the morn; tonight may see
   A faith renewed, a hope reborn — who knows?

Give over dreaming! What has never been
   May yet bear fruit, but what can never be
'Twere better to forget. This hour may mean
   The gateway that unlocks Eternity.

Old doubts, old griefs, old burdens, cast away —
Awake! oh Heart, arise! —fulfill Today!

And of life, their brother:

Busy with its cleaning;

A Son, To His Father, On Father's Day

This is your day, my Father, and the world
Will pause to do you honor for a space.
Last night I watched you, and my slow thoughts curled
About the growing lines upon your face.

My thoughts were not of baseball, nor brown arms
Of swimmers, cleaving water in the sun;
My thoughts were life — its burdens, its alarms,
And, over all, the courage you had wen.

This is your day, my father. We are men.
You will not want the flowers Mother would;
But let me tell you, just between us:   When
A boy's dreams fail, remembering you is good,

Remembering you is like a sudden, strong.
Clean gust of wind — to bear my youth along.

* As The Rain Cometh Down
"For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." - Isaiah 55:10-11

Softly the rain is falling in the night,
   Over the hills and valleys, premising
God will reclothe His world in robes of bright
   And living verdure:   soon there will be Spring.

Along the barren bough new life will creep
   And quicken in each tender blade and shoot:
The earth will waken from her long, long sleep,
   There will be bud and blossom, leaf and fruit.

Into my heart His gentle promise falls
   Like falling rain. All is not yet destroyed:
Though strife and sorrow rule, and sin appals,
   God's Word shall not return unto Him void —

It shall accomplish all His purpose planned.
Upon this blessed hope the heart can stand.

A Student Prayer

My Father is an architect in stone:
   His granite pinnacles projecting high
Into a far place, secret and alone,
   Stand sentinel against the quiet sky.

Their beauty is a deep and still delight,
   Their solid strength a challenge to the soul
Calling my spirit to some lonely height,
   Lifting my life toward some splendid goal.

Beholding these, I am remembering
   Another Stone, rejected once of men:
When earth's foundations totter, let me cling
   To Jesus Christ, the Rock of Ages; when

I build my young life, tall and straight and slim,
Oh let it be a structure built on Him.

At hone with God.... Now, in that blest abode,
   She rests, her earthly burdens all laid down.
How was it when she took the last long road
   That led from earth to glory and her crown?

I cannot think she said goodbye and turned
   To walk down dark and unfrequented ways.
This was familiar ground to one, who learned
   To be at home with Him through all her days.

* At The Cross

"And sitting down they watched him there." - Mathew 27:36

And sitting down they watched Him there, the One
   Who stilled the tempest, multiplied the bread,
Walked on the water and, from sun to sun.
   Laid hands upon the sick, and raised the dead.

They saw Him dying on the cross of shame.
   Some watched with pity, some with scorn; and some,
A faithful few who had believed He came
   To reign as King, with grief were stricken dumb.

They watched Him there. But oh, they did not know
   How many, through the years, would watch Him, too.
And never be the same again, but go
   From that dark Hill, regenerated, new:

No longer victims of sin's deep despair,
But born again — because they watched Him there.

Of those dim others whcm my heart revered
   Be not afraid, Beloved, nor let live
One jealous thought; their spirits are endeared
   Only as dreams to me. Love does not give

Itself so much to persons, as to all
   The shy sweet wonder of a world that moves
Through magic days. The intimate, the small,
   And mostly love itself, the lover loves.

And less to men than to the wind and trees,
   The silent stars, I made my early vows.
You drink my soul with every breath of these.
   While those pale shades before whctn memory bows,

Forgotten are their names, their faces gone;
Only the love they wake, in you lives on.

A Tryst With Hills

I have a tryst to keep when spring returns,
   A tryst with hills, green garbed and wondering
Through all these winter days within me burns
   The fever of the song my lips shall sing

When free at last, to keep my tryst I go
   Out of the citys gate unto the hills.
Green hills awaking from a dream of snow
   To long day-dreams of wind and daffodils.

While yet remembrance of departed rain
   Lurks in a few lost tears on blade and leaf
I will arise and seek them once again.
   Fling from my shoulders days of winter grief

Stoop to the earth and kiss them every one
Hills I have loved through long, long days of sun.

* Attitudes

The days are mirrors that reflect ourselves,
   And who shall say if life be this or that?
Regardless of the proof for which man delves,
   The world, in truth, is neither round nor flat,

But many-sided, myriad and strange,
   As limitless in scope as all desire,
All duty, all resolve, all dreams that change
   The boundaries of earth to something higher.

Unto the bee the world is all perfume.
    Blown skyward from the rose. Unto the mole,
Darkness, the friendly feel of earth, and room -
    To stretch the flesh. And each has proved the whole

For life is not a pattern cut to fit —
We make it by the way we look at it.

Here in the autumn twilight beauty lies
   Upon the hills, as motionless as sleep.
There will be stirring where the shadows creep
   Down in the marsh grass, as the heron flies,

And motion higher, in the dreaming skies,
   When hcming wings reach up and climb the steep
Ascent of heaven; but the hills will keep
   Beauty, so still, one wonders if it dies.

There is no name for beauty that can be
   A thing so quiet as that far, faint line
Of purple silence, guarded by a tree
   So straight, so still, it scarcely seems a pine.

Here in the shadowed dusk one can but see,
And reach for wonder words will not confine.

Out of the dust I rise and go to be
A part of heaven's arched immensity:
Now I am one with all the birds that try
The vast -uncharted regions of the sky.

I climb the air, below me lies unfurled
The gold and azure beauty of a world
Of sand and sea, of mountains reaching too
For something that awaits them in the blue.

These are the things that He has made. But now
I leave than far beneath and go to plow
The meadows of the sky, with every clod
A fleecy cloud bank from the hand of God.

A child of space, earth baffles me no more.
And life's perplexities resolve. I soar
With hope restored again, and faith renewed:
Alone with God, my soul gains altitude.

Though well I know this place of sun and star
Is not my home — I dwell where people are —
Through all earth's dusty days my spirit sings:
I feel the pull of sky, the lift of wings!

* A Village Churchyard

The silence of unuttered dreams has turned
   This village churchyard to a thing more still
Than starlight sleeping on a winter hill;
   For fled is now the wild romance that burned

In youthful hearts; and aged ones, that yearned
   For greater wisdom, can no more fulfill
Their own desires. At rest from good or ill.
   They sleep in silent trenches, unconcerned.

Yet here is quiet born not all of pain,
   For budding grasses speak of hope not dead,
And mingled with green blades the poppie's red
   Gives promise of desire that blooms again;

As though the dreams life would not let than keep,
The dead had found more beautiful in sleep.

A Wild Rose

I came upon a fairy
   In her sylvan-glade boudoir —
(She was at her morning toilet
   And forgot to shut the door!)

I saw her trailing bath-robe
   Made of shinmering folds of green
All trimmed in silver dew-drops,
   Like a jewelled fairy queen.

And I know she was a Princess,
   For I saw her gold crown gleam
As she bent her pink face downward
   To wash it in the stream.

   If anybody knows—
I went back once to ask her,
   But only found a rose!)

Ballad For Any Summer

He was a sailor's son,
Bore with the tug of water
Pulling hard at his sleeve
She was a hill-man's daughter.

She was a woodland fern,
Plucked from the quiet places .
He was a lifted sail,
Stretched for the windy spaces.

He found her shyness sweet,
Smiled at her naive greeting;
Something big in his heart
Hastened her own heart's beating.

Under the August moon
Faith that he thought enduring
Broke with the sea and sail,
Finding her more alluring.

Once, when the silence spread
Close as a cloak around than,
Love was a tide that swept
In from the sea and drowned them.

There in the moonlight, he
Promised never to fail her:
He was a lover now,
More than he was a sailor.

Ah, but he had no wit,
Not on the sea to reckon:
Scarce had the summer waned
When it began to beckon.

He was a sailor's son:
All that a sea-man misses,
Inland, pulled at his heart,
Smothering her young kisses.

Often her blue eyes brim:
Grieving to have bereft her,
Often he wakes at dawn.
Nevertheless, he left her.

Weep for the sea's bright call,
Weep for her hearts undoing:
She was a hill-man's child,
Born for a hill-man's wooing.

She was a mountain maid,
Born to be wife and mother,
But for a sea-man's love,
Now she will wed another.

Now, as she tucks in seeds,
Out in her garden kneeling,
Eyes that are bright with dreams
Follow a lone gull's wheeling.

Follow a far sky trail.
Blue as the sea, for token.........
Never a sail turns home,
Home to a heart thats broken.

Weep for a sumner's schemes.
Weep for the hearts that find them,
Follow, and then go back -
Leaving a dream behind than.

Our Bettsey has a way with tots —
A way with all of us —
And who could blame a certain lad
For getting amorous?

So Bettsey's going to take the step,
And she will never rue it,
If she can just remember this:
"Let George do it!"

With dishes, or with diapers.
It makes no difference,
This simple slogan of four words
Is just plain sense.

For Bettsey. wearing dish-pan hands!
(Base thought — I do eschew it)
A better plan by far would be
To "let George do it'."'

For Bettsey is a glamor gal
And pedigogue in one —
A laughing sprite, a tiny grim
Authoritarian;

And, having such a bright career,
We hope she will pursue it....
So, in the simple tasks of life
Just "let George do it."

Good wishes, Bettsey, as you go;
God speed you on your way,
And give you happy years ahead —
A happy wedding day.

We'd really like to"kiss the bride."
Is she just only knew it,
But, since this might embarrass her,
We'll "let George do it."

For He was there, and every moment of

Speak not of hopes deferred, of dreams laid down —
   Through all of these His presence has sufficed.
This was my joyous privilege, my crown:
   In every furnace, to have walked with Christ.

His banner over me was love. Let this
   And only this, be written where I lie,
When all life's toil and tears I shall dismiss;
   Raise over me this single battle cry —

Write it in words of flame for all to read.
Who knows the Saviour has no other need.

Could I not be taking up

And glory that shines frcm above:

Because of the Gift of God's love.

Chorus:
   Because He came, life has a fresh beginning.
   Because the Savior came all things are new;
   Because He died to make an end of sinning,
   The trusting heart can have its springtime too.
   
   Because He rose, all earth repeats the story,
   All nature wakes to join the glad refrain;

   Sing, now my soul — to Christ be praise and glory,
   Because He lives, because He lives again!

There is peace in the valley, though shadows may fall,
When all of life's journey is run;
There is peace in the Valley of Death, now for all
Who trust in the gift of God's Son.

There is peace in the valley and light on the hills,
And life in the quickening sod,
With grace that abounds and a rapture that thrills —
Because of the Gift of our God.

They stumbled through the dark that Easter morning
   And spoke in low, hushed voices of the Dead.
They brought their love, their spices for adorning,
   But walked with broken hearts, uncomforted.

They did not know that, even while they worried
   About the stone, the tomb had been defied:
How, with one simple gesture, calm, unhurried,
   The Lord they loved had laid all death aside.

They did not know; but every heart that sorrows
   Can know, today, the peace these words disclose
"He is not here." And all earth's dark tomorrows
   Will never be the same — because He rose.

Because Of Calvary

Give me an uncomp laining heart
   That is at terms with life,
Accepting graciously alike
   Serenity, or strife.

Give me an understanding heart
   That is at terms with men,
An overflowing love that gives.
   Not asking "why," or "when."

Give me a consecrated heart
   That is at terms with Thee,
Securely resting in Thy grace —
   Because of Calvary.

Because Of Calvary

We touch the fringe of God's magnificence
    When we behold His earth and sky and sea;
But none of this is peace or permanence,
    Until we glimpse our God at Calvary.

Chorus:

    What peace it brings, what joy and ecstacy.
    To know Christ died to set the sinner free!
    It binds the heart to Him eternally:
    Forever His — because of Calvary.

God's magnitude the heart cannot express,
    Until it sees how much He sacrificed.
For God, who hung the world on nothingness,
    Reveals Himself, alone, in Jesus Christ.

Why should we grasp at God's infinitude,
    Why should we reach for starry realms of space,
When all of time is but an interlude
    On which to pose the glory of His grace?

* Before The Easter Dawn

What whisper stirs among the olive trees.
   Where late the Saviour prayed? What gesture lifts
The little leaves, as though some secret breeze
   Were fingering the branches? Through the rifts

In darkness, what is this that slowly seeps
   Like mellow sunlight through the garden gloom?
There is no wind, no sun, as yet. Earth sleeps.
   This is the miracle within the tomb!

No passing breeze, no transitory breath
   Of air, could move these trees in such a way.
This is the breath of Life, come back frcm death.
   And this new radiance is not the day:

It is the Light of all the world, restored
Forever more — in Christ, the risen Lord.

What walks behind the curtain of the rain?
   Stirs something there that is afraid to speak,
Afraid, or else some dim, forgotten pain
   Has hushed the groping word, but through the bleak

Uncertain silences, distinct and near,
   A footstep hovers—nay, a hand,
Reaching for something intimate and dear,
   Something remembered in a long-lost land.

What time the wind makes utterance in leaves,
   What time cool drops feel earthward, to and fro
Something behind the still rain moves and grieves,
   Fretting the dusk with sounds that will not go

The way of words, but falter—pause—and break,
Wounding themselves upon an old heartache.

* Behold, The Dawn!

Hills that have borne the burden of the night,
   Lift to the sudden dawn bewildered eyes —
For kindled heart the fires torturing the skies
   With fear of flame, with something less than light

And more than beauty, are but cold affright
   To hills on whom remembered midnight lies.
How slowly in each waking bosom dies
   The dream it keeps of stars, serene and white!

But it will die, when out of space is born
   The great One Flame. And now that wakes, that wakes!
And stars are less than whispers blown about;
   The peace of midnight is a thing outworn;

And from the hills a mighty triumph breaks,
Greeting the Sun with many-throated shout!

Behold The Lamb Of God

I looked, and lo! a Lamb. Throughout the ages,
   The endless eons of eternity,
The fairest picture found on heaven's pages
   Will be the one that speaks of Calvary.

The sweetest anthem, even in the Glory,
   Will not be some exalted new refrain,
But just the old familiar gospel story:
   "How worthy is the Lamb for sinners slain!"

Behold the Lamb of God, O lost and lonely,
   Behold Him here and now, if you would share
His presence in the other world. For only
    The ones who love Him here will see Him there.

* Beloved It Is Night

Beloved it is night. Lift not thy face —
   Pass through the garden with a muted voice;
This is the hour of dreaming. This the place
   Where out of time the One Dream of our choice

May suddenly be born. But speak no word —
   Let fall one whisper even, and the rose
That sleeps by yonder casement, would be stirred
   To dream of things not any flower knows.

Lift not thy face. Beloved. It is night ——-
   Dusk and a silence in the garden blend.
But in thy face is wonder born of light,
   And in my heart a song that knows no end.

A light, a song....Beloved, turn away
Lest all the garden wake and call it day!

* Benediction

When sleepy birds wake up to greet the dawn
   With songs of praise, and like a silver scroll
The morning sky unfolds to wait upon
   The ccming of the sun, then lifts my soul

Its canticle of love, O Christ, to Thee —
   Creator of the whole. My glad heart pours
Its gratitude in floods of ecstacy
   And, like a bird, my spirit sings and soars.

But comes the dusk, the time for sheltering,
   When drooping pinions fold on drowsy birds,
My heart seeks out its shelter too. I sing
   No more:  Thou art  too near for need of words;

Thy quiet hand is on my heart to bless,
And I am wrapped in Thy great gentleness.

I  — Visitor From Yesterday

Whoever reads may find himself a host
   To more than words:  a quaint, invisable,
Disturbing presence, moving like a ghost
   From yesterday. A strangely lovable,

Engaging ghost, who cannot quite forget:
   "Poor Richard" leans from out the past to peer
At how the line is spaced, the type is set.
   He almost seems to say, "What have we here?"

II  — He Dreamed A Stove

Perhaps from out the gleaming coals it came,
   When backs were freezing and each face grew hot,
The swift idea: why not capture flame
   And lock it in a box? Why not, why not?

It might have been like this. Nobody knows
   Just where the thought is born that makes the deed.
Nor really cares, just so it grows and grows
   And reaches out to fill a heart-felt need.

He dreamed a stove. But oh, he dreamed much more:
   The smell of home-made bread and popping com,
The old men gathered at the country store;
   And children, huddled on some icy mom,

With hands outstretched. All cherished, all esteaned.
All simple, warm and friendly things — he dreamed.

III  - Man With A Kite

Was he a boy upon a windy hill,
   His kite-string in his hand, when first he knew
The wild applause of thunder and the thrill
   Of lightning flashing on the startled view?

Was he a boy, when first he felt the pull
   Of something stronger, stronger than the wind:
A young idea, bright and beautiful,
   That could be more, if harnessed, disciplined?

And did he run along the hills with it
   And toss it, with his kite, into the sky;
Then draw it to himself and try to fit
   The thought into the scheme he meant to try?

How many years, how many kites took flight,
Before he knew he held the key to light!

IV — Fire! Fire!

No matter where he went, or what he saw,
   He had a spark that kindled into flame.
The fire of learning and the fire of law
   Were both, alike, ignited in his name.

This is a truth philosophers confess,
   These are the things that statesmen talk about.
But any dozing school-boy cares much less
   For fires so started, than for those put out.

He planned protection. He could not foresee
   The racing engines, screaming sirens, all
The frenzied furor that would one day be
   Earth's high adventure for each eager, small,

Uplifted face — unmindful of school books —
Lost in a world of ladders, hose and hooks.

V  — Home town (Philadelphia, U.S.A.)

The youth who walked the shabby streets of home,
   Contesting for their shabbiness, could tell
What toil and tears it takes before men come
   With confidence to hang the freedom bell:

The long, long look along the years, that must
   Precede the written word, the law laid down.
For he, who holds the future in his trust,
   Must walk beyond the streets of any town.

Most men find daily living dull and slow:
   These only reach the ultimate by strife.
But some men garner greatness as they go
   About the ordinary tasks of life,

Seeing in simple things what few can see —
And these live larger than locality.

VI - Here Was America

Here was no man — but all men put in one:
   Creative though, inventive skill, and zeal
For perseverance at a task begun.
   Here was the high white hope that all men feel,

But few attain to. Here was reaching up.
   And getting under, probing deep; the far,
Raaote, ideal extended. Here the cup
   Of living held one bright, imprisoned star.

Here was America:   the  scathing more
   Than land, or language, something yet to be,
Not found in field or forest, hill or shore:
   The great enduring passion to be free.

Not just in documents upon a shelf,
But freedom written in the man himself.

* Beloved, Share Your Pleasure With The Wind

Go tell your joy to listening field and star,
   Beloved, share your pleasure with the wind;
Run in the light and fling your laughter far,
   In leaping wave and dancing sunlight find

Renewal of your mood,—but come not here.
   You will not need my touch, my spoken words
To add one little measure to your cheer.
   Beloved, give your singing to the birds.

But when your heart too quiet grows with pain,
   Slip through the dusk and come again to me;
Sobbing your grief like soft insistent rain,
   Yielding your broken faith to sympathy;

And in my wonan's peace find grace to bear
The only moment's that our love can share.

Bethany Supper

Lord, I have swept ray house and taken out
   Fine linen, silver, all to honor Thee;
And now at twilight, with these spread about,
   My heart reminds me with strange irony,

With mute misgivings and with vague -unrest:
   I have no gift to give, no feast to spread.
At every table where Thou wert the guest,
   It ever was Thyself who broke the bread.

Lord, I have been a Martha all the day,
   And now as darkness falls I am aware
That quiet Mary chose the better way.
   Thou Heavenly Guest, these hands would fain prepare

Thy welcome, but have naught to offer Thee —
Have pity, break the bread of life to me.

     Black Hounds Of Hades

Out of the darkness the black hounds are galloping:
   Young flesh is tender and young flesh is sweet.
White in the moonlight, their bared fangs are ravaging
   Every hushed heart in the cottage or street.

Fresh from each foray, with bloody jaws slavering,
   Widly they skirt the world, hungry for more;
Few are the dreams will be left on the morrow by
   Black hounds of Hades, the dark dogs of war.

He is so stalwart.....His bright face is clouded now.
   Young flesh is tender and young flesh is sweet.
Does he lie wakeful, too——-wide-eyed and listening
   Over and over to galloping feet?

       The Blind

The blind man, on the comer every day,
    Stands stretching forth his hand — but not for alms
He has the Truth of God to give away —
    A fresh supply of tracts. His troubling palms

Can hardly hold their treasure; and his lips
   Cannot control the current of his song;
He hums the old hymns softly as he slips
    A leaflet here and there among the throng.

He knows that most will pass and scarcely glance.
    But still, in rain or sunshine, he must try
To give the gospel, though men look askance.
    If he were peddling pencils they might buy,

In pity for lost sight; for most are kind.
They do not know he sees — and they are blind.
         97

* Blindness

For sightless eyes no pity do I crave,
   Who long have bowed submissive to Fate's will.

Life makes her gifts, and once to me she gave
   To look on Beauty. Deep I drank, -until
With very seeing did my eyes grow blind.
   (There is a joy too great for human sight!)

Mine be the curse. Alone, I am consigned
    Through endless days to walk, in utter night.

And yet, for very blindness do I see
    More faithfully and sure, who light dead eyes
With tapers from the shrine of memory.
    For still, proud seas, gaunt peaks and tawny skies,

Gray clouds, and trees, hold converse down the years,
Remembered and undimned by latter tears.

* Books

As one who stands upon the brink of Time
   And sees the planets circle into view,
So I regard my world of books. The new
   Are undiscovered realms of prose and rhyme,

Who knows what depths of thought, what heights sublime
   Of lofty truth, these shall invite me to?
But oh the old, my first-loves tried and true!
   These are my land of hone, my native clime.

A peaceful field I have in Emerson;
   Scott is a peak, and Keats a quiet bay;
Browning the mighty sea, and Tennyson
   A happy river singing on its way.

But Shakespeare, earliest love and most adored —
A continent forever unexplored.

Bridegroom's If

If you can keep your head when all about you
   She's losing hers, and blaming it on you;
If you can say, "I cannot live without you",
   E'en when the dishes fly (and know it' s true);

If you can find the bath-room all a-clutter
   With silken garments hanging up to dry,
And neither rage, nor snort, nor stomp, nor sputter,
   But whistle blithely on—nor bat an eye!

If you can taste each strange, uncertain mixture
   She sets before you—claiming to be food,
And keep your grin a bright and steady fixture
   While eating it—and even call it good;

If you can wait, and not grow tired in waiting,
   While she adorns herself for other eyes;
And when she prates of self don't deal in prating
   And yet don't act too good or look too wise;

If you can work for her and keep on grinning,
   Though all night long with weariness you toss;
And rise and start again at the beginning,
   And never breathe a word about your cross;

If you can fill each drab domestic minute
   With sixty seconds worth of tenderness;
Then take the plunge, my boy—go on, begin it —
   Your marriage will turn out a hugh success!

Brief Beauty

December twilight wanes. This dappled dusk
   Lives but a moment. Stand beside the gate.
But utter nothing. Anything so brusque
   As speech would shatter this brief beauty. Wait.

Wait while the new moon climbs above the hill,
   One stitch of silver threading through the sky.
Wait wordlessly, Beloved, wait until
   The darkness comes to cover us. Then cry.

Cry for the shortened days, the fading year,
   The stricken branches barren now of leaf:
That loveliness is lost, and we are here;
   And beauty is a thing so brief, so brief!
        104

Brief Courage

I saw a maple flaunt the crimson flame
   Of one leaf on the air
A gallant gesture to disguise the shame
   Of branches stricken bare.

I lifted laughter up to sway and toss
   Where joy no more occurs,
And whispered, "Heart, so shall we make our loss
   Magnificent as hers."

Bright Assault

With circling scimitar of light,
   Dawn creeps from out the ambush of the sky,
Cleaves downward to the earth—and startled night
   Slinks into shadow with a stricken cry

That mounts in blue mist from the sleepy hills,
   That curves in hazy drifts of gray and tawn.
That lifts and floats above the trees, and fills
   Each hollow with the great sob, "I am gone."

Where will the wondering and secret things,
   That hugged the dark, take refuge from the day?
Bereft of the cool covert of her wings,
   Where will night's children run and hide? O stay

This bright assault, this battery of light!
Spare little frightened eyes that hunt the night!

Broadway Christinas

Above the traffic, suddenly there swells
   An angel chorus—and the eyes grow wet.
While every shop with tawdry tinsel tells
   The Old, Old Story men cannot forget.

What though they died along Judean hills,
   Those angel voices—long ago—tonight
Above the tragedy of human ills
   Comes back the ancient anthem born of Light.

Because, along this street, each hungry heart
   Cries out for "Peace, good will", the sacred throng
Traverses centuries again to start
   Remembrance waking in the well-loved song

That falls on Broadway, as on Bethlehem——-
And men are hushed while God comes down to them.

Broken For You

"This is ray body, broken for you." So
    The Savior said; and climbed His lonely hill.
"Those were but words, and that was long ago,"
    The scoffers say—and yet I hear Him still.

Whenever I reach out to break the bread,
    Or take the cup, His stricken form appears,
His pleading voice entreats; and I am led
    To go to Him in penitence and tears.

That broken body breaks my stubborn heart
   And puts an end to all my foolish pride.
I weep as though no other had a part
   In that for which our Lord was crucified:

The burden of His cross is mine to bear —
As though my sin alone had put Him there.

Broken Fences

The brindle found it first. I wonder how
   A broken fence line does effect a cow.
Did she peruse her passport carefully?
   Or, quite consumed with curiosity,

Did she dash through the unexpected gate
   Without a moment's pause to ruminute?
There was a broken fence line long ago,
   Discovered by a boy I used to know,

He chose new pastures with the greatest ease,
   And never did look back. Yet every breeze
Life-long, that stirred the curtains of his mind.
   Blew, somehow, from that pasture left behind.

Broken Petals

Little Rose with broken petals,
Lying in my hand,
Tell me: do you grieve to lie so?
Do you fear to droop and die so?
I would understand,
Underneath those broken petals,
Do you fancy pain?

Fear not, when the spring shall find you
Doubt and grief no more shall bind you:
You shall bloom again.
Life is made of broken petals,
Fallen e'en as those,—
Scattered bits of dreams forsaken:
But at Dawn, when we awaken,
Lo! another Rose.

Brooks And Women

Small streams and women have too much to say;
   Ask any man and he will tell you that.
The constant babble of a brook at play,
   And women dropping in to sew and chat,

Too soon grow tiresome. Every man agrees
   Insessant chatter makes for little brain,
And so condemns the two, nor ever sees
   How brooks and wcmen talk to hide their pain.

Because the hearts of women are too proud
   To stoop to tears, they bid their longings hush,
another their grief, and smile and talk too loud.
    This is the way of women. And brooks rush

The same wild way, because they must forget
Old wounds of stick and stone that stab them yet.

That there is Hope.

Burn, candle, burn:
God is not high and far —
He dwells where cattle crunch,
Where children are.

Down every path
That weary mortals plod,
If you but listen, look,
You can find God.

Burn, candle, burn
Until all strivings cease —
Say to a troubled world
That there is_ Peace:

Once angels sang,
That all the world might sing.
Let every head be bowed —
Remembering.

* But Love Is More

Love is what all have said. But love is more:
   More than the brinming cup of tenderness,
The word, the glance, the touch. These all explore
   The fringe of love; but love is in excess

Of these. To realize its cherished goal.
   Love climbs the lonely mountains of the mind,
Love probes the secret caverns of the soul.
   Yet he, who thinks he sees love whole, is blind.

Love is what all have said. But love will be
   What none can say until, with clearer sight,
Through fadeless ages of eternity,
   We learn to read the simple word aright,

For God is love. The little we have known
Will find its ultimate in Him, alone.

But Not Our God;

God did not need to clothe the world with beauty,
He could have left it practical and plain:
He might have made all paths mere dust and duty,
Without the ministry of sun and rain.

But not our God, our gracious God.'
The verdant hills, the quickened clod,
Within a world of storm and strife,
Proclaim He is the Lord of Life.

God did not need to deck the night with splendor,
He could have left the world to carry on
Without the stars, the moonlight warm and tender
He might have left earth desolate till dawn.

But not our God! He had to sow
The sky with stars, that we might know,
Through every dark and troubled night,
Our Father is the Lord of Light.

God did not need to leave His hone in glory
To take the sinner's place at Calvary,
That every man might share salvation's story
He could have left us lost eternally.

But not our God! He had to die
At Calvary, that you and I
Might share with Him that hone above -
Because He is the Lord of Love.

But Ye Are A Chosen Generation

"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;" - I Peter 2:9

These are not facts that fence us in below
   The doubts, the fears, the worry and the strife,
All of the vain earth problems that we know
   Here in the grim monotony of life.

We are not creatures of mere circumstance,
   Blown by the swift uncertain wind of time;
We nibble not the crumbled bread of chance —
   Ours is a heritage that is sublime.

There is a fact eternal in the skies:
   God's Son has triumphed o'er this house of clay
From out our earthly bondage we shall rise
   To glimpse the glory of His face some day.

This is the circumstance that knows no change:
   Christ died for the ungodly long ago;
This is the wonder, beautiful and strange:
   His fellowship the poorest soul may know.

Not alone at Avonshire

Everywhere and all the time

Every fragrant zephyr blown
   Over a new-mown hay
Calls me back to Bethlehem
   Where the wee Christ lay.

Not a silver ripple breaks
   On a river's brim
But is Jordan lifting spray
   As John buried Him.

When the twilight takes young hills,
   Every silent tree
Is a finger pointing us
   Back to Calvary.

And I never hear the dove's
   Mating music swell
But I turn to Pentecost
   Where His spirit fell.

Certainty

Whatever comes or doesn't come,
This I know,
There will be warm days again
After snow.

There will be warm days, and buds
Bursting through
Little coats to show themselves
Pink and new.

There will be the buds and then,
Almost near
Meadow larks will trill five notes
Swift and clear.

There will be the meadow larks
And a wall
Green with moss—and it may be
That is all.

But I hope (oh dare I hope?)
There will be
Something dearer than them all —
Just for me.

Over the hill's brow.

You are gone — but please,
When you come down, give my love
To the young Chinese'!.

But the forever.

   Not far beyond the setting sun
   But close and kind, the Blessed One,

He knows the healing ministry of hands,

But, more than body ills, he understands
   The deep, deep need of every patient's heart.

His kindness is a fire that lights the roan
   Against all chilliness:   he  has a way
Of smiling that dispels the deepest gloom,
   And skies that clouded are no longer gray.

God enters with him through the sick-room door;
   They probe together for the hidden hurt.
Men call him "doctor." He is this———and more.

He heals our scars and takes away our pains.
And then he goes; but somehow, God remains.

Dark the night and cold;
We will warm it with a story,
Sweetest ever told.

Sleep, my baby, gently slumber.
Blessed Jesus cares:
He who was Himself a baby
Hears a baby's prayers.

Sleep, my baby, gently slumber,
Jesus understands.
Oh, the love that God has proffered
In a Baby's hands!

Christmas Party

With mink and with sable
   For Christmas prepare,
(But God had a stable,
   And cattle were there),

With strutting and strumming,
   With fizz and with foam.
(Don't count on God coming:
   He won't feel at hone.)

* Christmas Song For Children

Green trees talk at Christmas time,
Low and very low,
Wist ye what the green trees say,
Children, do you know?

Speak they of a golden room,
Toys upon the floor,
Twinkle-candles in a row?
Yes, of these — and more.

Green trees talk at Christmas time.
Low and very low,
Of the world's first Christmas tree,
Long and long ago.

There was neither golden roan.
Toy, nor candle-gleam;
But there was a Light indeed —
Wist ye of its beam?

It was still, oh very still,
Out on Calvary
When God hung His Christmas Gift,
Christ, upon the Tree.

Now, when Christmas candles shine,
Now, when yule-logs sing,
Children, hush, and bow the head,
Once — remembering.

* Christmas Wish

I wish I had been the star that pointed
   Down through the long, long years
To the Christ who should come for sin's atonement
   Making an end of tears.

Though all the night had been dark around me,
   Though other stars grew dim,
I should have shone with a special splendor —
   Knowing I shone for Him.

I wish I had been the heart of Mary,
   Simple and undefiled —
Waiting the long, long watch with Joseph,
   Eager to hold God's child;

Though all the world had been filled with music —
   Voices the shepherds heard,
I should have leaned my ear to hearken
   Only the Word, the Word.

The star and the bam are an ancient story.
   Clothed in the mists of time;
And Mary has gone the way of women,
   After her task sublime;

But I am alive, and wishful thinking
   Happily I dismiss:
I am alive to shine and shelter
   And there is need of this.

Christ, The Lord, Has Come

1. When all the world was lost in sin,
   And God seared very far,
   Above the darkness of the earth
   He pinned a single star.
   
   And shepherds, watching in the fields,
   Were startled at the sight:
   The angels sang, the shadows fled —
   And all they saw was light.

CHORUS
   The song resounds,
   The light abounds,
   For Christ the Lord has come.
   Today, as then,
   He comes to men —
   Oh, make your heart His home!

2. Though all mankind had gone astray,
   By sin and shame undone.
   Our God could not forget His world:
   He sent His only Son.

   And Mary, by the manger bed,
   Sang softly to the Boy:
   Her pain and weariness were gone,
   And all she felt was joy.

3. Though sin and sorrow rule the world,
   And man is born to strife,
   Instead the ugliness of death
   God gives Eternal Life.

   And all who trust redeeming grace
   Will find a sweet release:
   The Lord has come. Give Him your heart.
   He'll give you joy and peace.

City Park

Let me look long upon this cool and still
Green epic of the earth, wedged in between
The walls of industry, this quiet scene
Where comes no traffic rumble, nor the shrill
Newsboy announcing. Let me sit and fill
My homesick heart with other gold and green:

The sifted gold of sunlight through the lean,
Dark shapes of pines upon a far-off hill.
Man's most need, though he rush and toil and fret
For food and raiment, is not met in these.
The naked soul has need of canopies
Of silence; and the hungers that beset
The lone heart are appeased by nothing less
Than growing beauty, clothed in quietness.

Cling To His Hand

 1. When the clouds of trouble gather,
    When the shades of night descend.
    There is One who walks beside you —
    He will keep you to the end.

   Chorus:

    Night may be long, but the heart need not fear it,
    Sky may be dark, but God's morning will clear it;
    Whisper a prayer, for the Savior can hear it —
    Cling to His hand in the dark.

2.  When you think you are forgotten
    By the friends that you have known,
    There is One who still remembers
    One who never leaves His own.

3.  Christ has been this way before you,
    He has walked each lonely road;
    When the burdens seem too heavy
    Let the Savior share your load.
    
4.  Only doubters faint and falter.
    Walk by faith and not by sight —
    In the heart of every shadow
    Dwells the lovely Lord of Light.

* Come II Faut

Love is a nectar — we have tasted it,
   A bloom and we have plucked it, you and I;
Love is a book wherein the gods have writ
   Those mortal joys which they cannot supply;

Love is a mirror where we only see
   Reflected what is comely to the view;
Love is a halo which you make for me,
   And love a rod with which I measure you.

All this we know, and this does love fulfill
   In all our hearts; yet are we not content
To deem our love immortalized until,
   Groping for light in blind bewilderment,

We come at last, through sacrifice and loss,
To know love is a crown of thorns, a cross.

* Commentary On Plowing: The Poet

The new-turned furrows sprawl beneath the sun;
   Dusky and silent, earth awaits her time
Of blossoming. Now hardly will be won
   The white dawn-flicker, when the will to climb

Shall stir the seed:   this darkly  ribboned field,
   Drowsy with dreams, will wake to sudden zest,
In sinuous undulations the green yield
   Of beauty will become a dream confessed.

Yet not the pregnant premises of wealth
   In grain, or vintage, woe me—I am bound
To this sweet idle moment. The slow stealth
   Of one small field mouse, and the brittle sound

Of black clods crunching, I shall wake to find
How often, down the furrows of the mind!
           141

* Commentary On Plowing: An Old Woman

The plow cuts deep, the new-turned earth lies black
   As grief turned over in the heart. The land
Has heard a question and has given back
   The answer:   in  a dark but certain hand

The slow script runs. Each furrow in the sun
   Lies cool and isolate. The plow cuts deep,
Strikes at the roots; and slowly, one by one,
   The earth gives up the secrets she would keep.

How often, in the brown fields of the heart,
   The plow cuts deep; for furrows of despair
Yield annual increase. But all ripe grains start
   From deep-turned earth — and with the bright-eyed stare

Of yonder field mouse, in my heart's field one
Small covert dream blinks all day at the sun..

* Comes The Dawn

All night the stormy vanguards of the sky
   Besieged the battered earth. The twisted trees
One moment tossed their wind-swept branches high;
   The next, bowed low upon their suppliant knees.

Now morning breaks: the dreary landscape swims
   In sunlit glory; and the gaunt trees stand
At ease, to rest their worn and weary limbs.
   Now gentleness comes back to all the land.

So hush, my heart, and trust: for surely He,
   Who stills the storms in nature, knows the way
To touch the tumult in each life, and be
   Himself the sunrise and the perfect day.

He dries all tears. Beyond this haggard night
There will be peace again — and warmth and light.

* Compassion Is Thy Name

When I behold the thirsty stalks of grain
Uncurl long fingers to the cooling rain
And write in green the premise of the wheat,
Because Thy grace provides that man may eat,

Then I recall the hungry multitude —
The curious, the eager, faint for food ——
The loaves and fishes shared with all who came.
O Son of God — Compassion is Thy name!

* Coins

Two coins, two polished coins, are mine to hold,
   Are mine to spend or cherish as I will,
And one I hoard as misers hoard their gold,
   And one, alas, too carelessly I spill.

O Life, my second coin, how recklessly
   Your shining days slip through these finger-tips!
But Love, my first, I guard you jealously,
   Against the touch — the wild sweet touch — of lips.

But if there come (and oh I know there must!)
   One in whose eyes naj glories wake for me,
I'll take my Love and spend it for a crust
   To feed his soul through all eternity.

Then Life, grown strangely precious at his touch,
Shall be the coin I cherish overmuch.

Confidences

Heart, never talk with trees in green
They are not trusty, quite.
For what they hear in confidence
They whisper of at night.
Go laugh and play and sing with them.
Their own bright wisdoms glean,
But still the urge that coaxes lips
To talk with trees in green.

And if a secret longing stirs
That will not settle down,
Heart take your little wistful dreams
And talk with trees in brown.
Bare branches on your cheek will be
As soft as finger tips;
Heart, they will know and never speak
Old sorrows seal their lips.

Consecration

That I may have the confidence
Life's great attempts to try,
Night after night I keep my faith
With white stars, still and high.

That I may have the patient grace
To meet dull circumstance,
Day after day I keep my eyes
On countless plodding ants.

And which renews my spirit most,
Or why, I cannot tell;
Only, between the two lies God,
Somewhere — I know it well.

* Consecration

Men build their temples unto God,
Magnificent and high.
Their domes and spires are lifted up;
But God may pass them by.

To dwell in temples made by hands
Is not His chosen plan:
He seeks the humble, human heart.
God's temple is the man;

Man's hope of glory, Christ within.
How strange and marvelous
That God should choose this house of clay
Inhabited by us!

Most gladly let us then give place
And dedicate afresh
To Him, whose right it is to reign,
This temple of the flesh.

Conversation

First tuck your tulip bulbs beneath the sod,
   Then make a place for pansies. Did you know,
Dear little boy, that now you work with God?
   He made a garden in the long ago;

He makes all gardens yet. Ho seed can sprout
   Without His care. He sends the rain, the sun:
No flower wakes and pokes its bright face out
   Unless He guards and cherishes each one.

And did you know that, when His loved ones chose
   A place for Jesus, after He had died,
They found a garden — and frcm there He rose,
   That first glad Easter morning, glorified?

So make your garden, little boy, each spring:
God gives us gardens — for remembering.

* Consider This

Consider this, when from the chafing bond
   Of life's activity you steal away
To quiet dreams, consider this:   a pond
   Fringed with blue iris has somewhat to say:

Keen sparkling wit of ripples, reveries,
   Cool-browed and still beneath the lotus-pad,
These, and the grave assurances of trees
   Bending above, are largess to be had.

Consider this:   no bright pool of the mind,
   Where thought has emptied and where wisdom lies
Captive, can give you more than you will find
   In one small pond — face lifted to the skies,

Back on the earth, and slim arms stretched about
Blue iris flung to heaven like a shout!

    Consolation

All life begins in wonder,
And ends in wandering.
But in between are beauty,
And toil and suffering;

And in between are children,
With little, trusting, eyes;
And light and love and laughter;
And books to make one wise;

Great moments of endeavor;
Brief moments of content;
And all the song and sunshine
For which the world was meant.

The old may faint and falter,
But still the heart can lean —
When evening shadows lengthen —
Upon the in-between.
         152

* Contentment

There is a point beyond which longing ends,
   Where no more yearning is, nor any hope
Above the present need; where thought descends
   To cannon earth, and wishes cease to grope.

Contentment men have called it; and they make
   Of it a thing most diligently sought.
Not so with me:  I would  forever break
   The fragile thread of which content is wrought.

Give me the will to seek; the thought that lifts
   The humble heart on pinions of desire.
It is the weak, the stagnant, soul that drifts
   In calm content — too feeble to aspire.

Who finds most Life must most for living strive;
For only by our longings do we live.

* Could Ye Not Watch?

"What, could ye not watch with me one hour?" - Mathew 26:40

He is tireless in His care for all
   Of us! He slumbers not, the blessed Christ,
So diligent to serve. When I recall
   The joy of heaven that He sacrificed

To walk awhile with men, His healing touch,
   So swift to comfort all who suffered loss,
His busy hands that served so well, so much —
   Those loving hands, nail-pierced upon the Cross——-

Then I remsnber dark Gethsemane;
   And out of silence I can hear Him say,
"Could ye not watch with me one hour?" He
   Was ever watchful of their needs; but they

Had slept through His. How could, how could they do
This thing? But what of me? And what of you?

      Counselor's Lament
   (Antidote for Ego Inflation)

We counseled and cajoled them,
   We read their little minds,
And in our dally records,
   We catalogued our "finds";

But when we met their teachers
   (In spite of smile and smirk)
Their inevitable greeting
   Was, "Well, it doesn't work."

We equipped ourselves with "gadgets"
   And "gimcracks" to delight;
We consulted with the "experts"
   Far, far into the night;

But, the more we read about them,
   (to classify each quirk)
The more their teachers told us,
   "My dear, it doesn't work."

We dealt with "temper tantrums,"
   The "timid" and "withdrawn";
We slept, and dreamed about them,
   From midnight unto dawn;

We searched for "all the answers",
   (our task we did not skirk) ...
Their teachers had one answer,
   "Too bad — it doesn't work!"

We know we have been faithful
   And tried to understand;
And really - if you ask us —
   We think we're pretty grand;
 
But let's be very humble,
   Let' s neither rave nor rant,
We're sure we understand them.
   But still their teachers can't!!

 Now one star shines above the hill,
Pinned to a pine so dark and still.

 Upon the hillslope huddled sheep
Are little woolly mounds of sleep.

 The cattle, housed and wanned and fed,
Stand dozing by the manger bed.

 With star and sheep and fragrant hay,
How can the Child be far away?

 Though angel throngs have given place
To satellites that whirl in space,

 This country Christmas it would seen
That peace on earth is not a dream.

The little, lonely schoolhouse by the road,
   With vacant windows empty-eyed and still,
Seans listening for scampering of feet,
   For laughter tossed from hill to sunny hill.

The big bus comes to take the children, now.
   In modem, well-equipped and oversized
New buildings education will go on,
   Completely up-to-date and organized.

But do not tear the little schoolhouse down:
   It is not roof and walls and floor, alone,
But something lost and loved and intimate —
   A way of living that is almost gone.

A shelter for the feathered and the furred,
   There let it stand and weather to decay:
Man needs one little guidepost pointing back,
   Amidst the frenzied furor of today.

Nothing is quite so full of pleasure

Nothing is quite so full of merit

Nothing is quite so full of wonder
As a dream that floats when the rest go under.

You asked me, "What is courage?" And I took
   The dictionary down and spelled it out.
For such a little boy, the heavy book
   Was ponderous. You twisted it about;

You said, "It's being brave — and what is that?"
   You said, "It's not to fear — am I afraid?
Does courage arch its back up like our cat,
   And spit at everything it meets?" you said.

Perplexed, we closed the book and took a walk.
   And came where fire had worked untimely death;
The woods were gone. But on a slender stalk
   A flower inched for life. I caught my breath.

"Courage," I said, and took you by the hand,
"Is one white flower in a fire-swept land."

Life, at your feet I lay the choicest gifts
That I can give,
Nor question aught, if only in me throb
The will to live,

The will to face tomorrow, though its way
Be steep or rough.
I give you, Life, for courage all I own —
Is this enough?

My hopes, my dreams, my stubborn youthful pride
That will not fail;
If these be not sufficient value, Life,
What can avail?

Nay, must I borrow? Then I'll ask of Love,
"A boon, I pray."
And Love shall buy me courage and the faith
To face each day.

Courage

What is so still as a road in the moonlight?
   What is so pale as a star at the dawn?
What is so brave as a heart that keeps singing,
   After the reason for singing is gone?

Morning will shatter earth's moon-stricken silence,
   Night will bring back the glow to a star —
Nothing, oh nothing, shall challenge the courage
   Of hearts that keep singing when song is so far.

Country Doctor

He dealt with broken bodies. He would scoff
   At careless pleasure lazy leisure yields.
But every Thursday, on his one day off,
   He took the boy and walked the open fields.

There, tall against the skyline, he would stand,
   Then turn and stoop to earth and cup a clod
And place it gently in the small boy’s hand.
   You knew he spoke to him of growth, and God.

You knew he looked along the far frontiers
   Of all tomorrows, when the boy would be
The man, in need of wisdom for the years,
   In need of strength and of tenacity.
Against the troubled times of death and birth,
   He gave his son this contact with the earth.

Courage, Resourcefulness, Character

From many walks of life they come,
   Who can no longer walk;
And, far from home, they make a home
   Of laughter and of talk.

They bring their courage in their hands,
   Whose hands can hardly hold
Another thing. Each understands
   Before he has been told.

They find resourceful ways to share
   The burdens not their own,
And carry all, who would not dare
   To carry one alone.

Upon another's need they wait,
   Less fortunate than they;
I see them standing, tall and straight,
   Who must sit down all day;

I see them standing so because,
   With scarce a dream fulfilled,
They toil and toil, without a pause —
   What character they build!

Though muscle or though sinew shrink,
   They still pursue their goal.
These are less handicapped I think
   Than many who are whole.

Creed

I believe in the beauty
Of wings against the night
A gull cleaving the darkness
With slow stains of light.

I believe in the wisdom
Of words along the shore:

Hushed, saying no more.

I believe in the wonder
Of love within the heart:
Poised like a gull drifting,
A wave, ready to start.

* Cross-Roads

Hither and yon they call to me,
And whither shall I go?
The broad highway walks straight ahead -
'Tis smooth and white I know;

And yet the gray road beckons,
With every curve a lure:
It just goes stumbling on its way —
I'd like to take it, sure.

There are crowds upon the highway,
And signs to make it plain;
But somewhere down the gray road
I smell the breath of rain —

The wind comes out to coax me,
With soft beguiling tone,
The leaves reach out their little hands
The highway walks — alone.

The rose, that like a crimson taper burned
   At dawn within the garden's hallowed shrine,
Already fades, each brilliant petal turned
   To rust along the edges. So decline

Beauty and youth. But when the rose shall lie
   A scattered ruin in the grass, I know
Light winds will steep and stir and lift on high
   The wondrous fragrance that it lived to show.

Love is a rose that for a moment flamed,
   Though life has crushed the petals one by one
Beloved, lift your face, be not ashamed,
   Nor strive our altered circumstance to shun -

Life leaves us still this truth to think about:
Each bloom is crushed to bring the sweetness out.

Silence is drifting like sorrow
   Into the streets of the town;
Day is a lost tomorrow,
   Seeking a vanished crown.

Day is a drab, insistant,
   Threadbare, familiar tune;
Life is a non-resistant.
   Only a scant white moon.

Plucking with nervous fingers
   The broken strings of the heart.

Dartmoor Dusk

Give me your hand — and let the twilight gather
   Home to the moor
Wish-hound and pixy and a gaunt gray shadow
   To stalk our door.
Blow on no embers of unlit tomorrows,
   Slip off no husk
From withered yesterdays; but clasp this moment
   And Dartmoor dusk.

Now to its daily round of care returns
   The world, that for a season sought relief
In slumber from the manifold concerns,

Ecstatic instant, wonder born of light
   Clothes with romance sights cannon, figures dull;
Creeps frcm the east a tremor of the night
   That mounts in wind and passes to a lull.

Somewhere I know, like this, another dawn
   With rosy fingers reaches for the day;
Somewhere, I know, its glory falls upon
   Another landscape, other winds at play,
 
And one who dreams, and slumbering forgets——-
Freed for a moment from the old regrets.

Now is a green mist present on the trees
   On tiptoe standing, hushed and hesitant.
What shy and intimate expectantcies
   Disturb their branches, where the pale gold slant

Of sunlight finds them? These are quickened now:
   The secret pulse of life beats soft within,
Prys at the surface, creeps along each bough.
   The ancient miracle will soon begin.

Tomorrow will bring pattern out of mist:
   The thin cool leaves, uncurled and delicate,
Will waken to a world sun-drenched, wind-kissed.
   But for that glory, now the heart can wait:

The heart can dream awhile, content to cling

The earth has gone back to her sleeping

Too tired to extinquish the embers,

The goldenrod. Here for a moment

By something too sinister, chilly,
   Reach out and be warmed.

Along Life's winding way,
And some are dull, some dreamy-eyed;

Strew smiles and flowers at my feet,
Then shyly squeeze my hand
And run ahead to point the way —
Dear days that understand.

Days

Sane days one touches lightly
As sea-gulls touch the foam,
Finding no joy, for dreaming
Of joy that is to come.

Or luring ghosts of laughter
Down dim forgotten ways
Where light winds stir the ashes
Of buried yesterdays.

To-day I have lived deeply,
On currents strong and free
As those that sweep the ocean
This day has carried me

Where Yesterday is only
A faint receding shore,
And somewhere lurks Tomorrow
An island to explore.

But I am kin to neither,
For me does naught exist
Save wide gray seas of water
And freedom and a mist.

No day has been save this one,
No day shall ever be,
All else I will touch lightly
To keep this memory.

Death Comes To All

"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." — Matthew 28:20

Death comes to all. But death is never all,
   For those who look into the Savior's face.
Within the shadowed valley these recall
   His blessed premise:   that the God of grace

Goes with them. When the forms of loved ones fade,
   His form grows clearer. These are not bereft
And unbefriended:  they are glad  to trade,
   For heaven's joy, the earthly joys they left.

Death comes to all. But oh, how different
   For those whose empty hearts have never known
That, for their soul's salvation, Christ was sent.
   All such must walk the last, dark road — alone.

Death comes to all. But not to all the same:
Some go to meet it in the Savior's name.

Dead Men Speak The Truth

"Brother, slept you very well
   This and yesternight?"
"Nay, I dreamed again of earth."
   "Such dreams were delight."

"Nay, I heard a Cause upheld,
   Saw the young eyes glow;
And I fear men seek again,
   Brother, what we know."

"Have you then no pride of death.
   You who gave your Youth?"
"Nay, the grave has humbled me:
   Dead men speak the truth."

By some fancy now it seems
   I remember you —
Brother, were you not of those
   That my own hand slew?"

"So I was. But do you now
   Any part recall
Of all the glory that was yours,
   Or why we fought at all?"

"Nay, I only know the wind
   Pierced me with his breath;
And the night was very still...
   And you smiled in death."

"But the Cause, the noble Cause,
   That for which you bled?"
"Brother, I forgot the Cause —
   For thinking of you dead."

"What things shall a man lay down
   Then, if not his life,
To prove the glory of a Cause
   And justify the strife?"

"Brother, there is but one way,
   Honor's only test:
The first to lay his weapons down —
   He conquers all the rest."

"By our error we have found
   Wisdom for their need;
But woe, that for the truth we guard
   The nations still must bleed!"

Dear Teacher

all sunnier long the windows of his mind
   Were flung wide-open to the wind and sun.
Return to routine is so slow! Be kind,
   Be gentle, try to understand that one

Who walked in wayward wonder through a maze
   Of golden hours, one who listened long
To bird and brook, may find a well-turned phrase
   An antidote that is a bit too strong.

He will return to learning; but not yet:
   The corridors of thought are crowded still
With morning meadows where the grass was wet,
   With branches blowing on a windy hill.

He will return. Be patient with him, please:
One comes back slowly from such things as these.

He quaffed, and hung the dipper by the well.
   "Black gold," he said, "black gold ten miles away!
Hey Mai come here. You think we ought to sell?
   They struck oil on the Greensburg road today."

In quietness she moved to feed the pup.
   In quietness she turned and touched his hand.
"Now Pa," she said, "don't get you fussened up:
   The land's the thing, the clean, the lovely land."

He walked the worn path to the pasture bars,
   And leaned against the night; beyond the hill
He traced the slender pattern of the stars.
   Then came and cupped a dipperful, to spill

It out upon the ground. "Let's go to bed
A well was made for water, Ma," he said.

Dedication

"Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle." - Exodus 40:34

Now unto Thee, O Lord, we dedicate
   This work of heart and hand, this house to be
Thy dwelling place. The humble and the great,
   The rich, the poor, are all alike to Thee;

And each has need of Thee. However far
   The wandered may fare, when he shall come
To this, Thy house, oh let it be a star
   To guide his soul to heaven and to hone.

Be pleased to take. Most Holy and Most High,
   This house and make it Thine, For, Lord, unless
Thy presence shall remain to sanctify,
   This structure is but toil and emptiness.

For all of those who need Thy tender touch,
   Thy cleansing power, Thy redeeming grace,
We bring our little, Lord, now make it much.
   Oh let Thy glory come and fill this place.

Delightful Bondage

She had been young once, but she was too tired
   Most of the time now:  Children make a lot
Of work for mothers. Twice a year he hired
   Someone to help, and took her to a spot

Where there were shaded lights and muted strings
   And food she had not fixed. He loved to see
Her face light up:  She said, "It  gives me wings —
   Alone, like this, just like we used to be."

Over the salad plates her talk began:
   "Isn't the small one smart? And Becky dear?
I love her hair. When David is a man
   He'll show them all!" "Where shall we go from here?"

He asked. She said — in either eye a star —
"Let's go right home, and see just how they are!"

Departure

I have not known so still a day as this:
   The drowsy moments, fraught with memory,
Steal to the borders of departed bliss —
   And come no more. As vessels put to sea,

With sails half-furled, reluctant to forego
   The well-loved curve of friendly reef and hill,
Lazy with dreams, my quiet thoughts move——-slow
   As wings that lift, and flutter, and are still.

All day I have not spoken — but my lips
   Are tremulous with something more than sighs,
Guarding a last word that forever slips
   Farther into the silence; and my eyes,

Hungry with hope, turn often to the door —
Seeking a shadow that will fall no more.

Departure(2)

He whistled to his dog, and all was still;
   I watched him disappear beyond the hill.
"What be ye thinkin'?" all the neighbors said
   "Why be ye standin' there? The old man's dead

Son, death and taxes comes to everyone."
   I knew that they were right:  his  race was run
And yet I stood where he had stood before,
   Watching the sunlight through his sycamore,

And knew he was not in that lonely grave....
He whistled to his dog. I saw him wave.

* Detachment

If on some perfect planet we could stand
   And with disinterest view the lives we lead,
See, through our clearer eyes, the life indeed,
   Stripped of its daily dole — the small demand ——-

A clean-cut, naked fact; could we conmand
   The strength that we assume, the pride — our creed
Whereby in confidence we dare exceed,
   Or say we do, all else Creation planned?

Could we in that brief interval compare
   With tree, with rock, that neither stir nor fret;
With humble soil, that doth no pride beget;
   With all wild things that roam, and birds in air?

We could not. Yet we light our centuries
With, "Man shall have dominion over these."

Discovery

It is not dead, — the beauty that we knew:
   Long time it slept, Beloved, but today,
Beneath an old log where one violet grew,
   I found our hearts' young treasure laid away;

I found the tender words that had grown cold
   For lack of being said; I found the songs
That lit our every twilight hour of old,
   And all the wonder that to love belongs.

It had not died, Beloved: when God found
   That life would rob us of earth's little best,
He hid our golden secret undergound,
   And let a violet hold it to its breast —

Well knowing I would pass along that way.
I found all beauty we have known today.

Displaced Person

Old woman, old woman,
   Why do you sit
With the folded hands
   That refuse to knit?

Old woman, old woman,
   What have they done
With your spinning wheel
   And the wool you spun?

Old woman, old woman,
   Where are they now:
The hens you fed
   And the brindled cow?

Old woman, old woman,
   Why do you sigh
When the sirens blow
   And the cars whiz by?

Old woman, old woman,
   Life is strange:
Time is the wheel
And the spokes are change.

Doctors

Some men build bridges, arched against the sky,
   Bright spans of splendor with the strength of steel;
Seine build skyscrapers, gaunt and gray and high,
   Groping among the stars, as those who feel

For some remembered beauty lost in time.
   These have their little hour of acclaim:
One moment lifted to the heights sublime —
   The next, forgotten in the hall of fame.

Sane men build broken bodies:   stoop and take
   The scattered puzzle of disrupted life
And, fitting piece to piece together, make
   Order from chaos, harmony from strife.

These build with God; and time cannot erase
What they accomplish, nor obscure their place.

Doggerel For Jenny

Dear God, bless Dad and Mommie too,
And Mike and Debbie, all life through;
And bless all poodles, clipped and neat.
With ruffs around their necks and feet,

With slender legs and round-eyes stare -
God don't forget to bless Pierre.
God bless all aunts and cousins small,
And uncles short and uncles tall;

And bless all bird dogs brave and wise
With tails that point, and friendly eyes
And ears to hide them when they nod —
Remember "Mr. Gomery," God.

God bless all teachers, bad and good,
They try to do the things they should;
And bless all Dachsunds long drawn out,
With ends that wiggle in and out

Of all tight places where they squeeze -
Dear God, bless Schizo if you please.

Do Streets Remember?

Do streets remember, when the long dark makes
   A little silence in between two days
Of traffic, hew, somewhere, the sunrise breaks
   Across gold hill-tops and the sudden rays

Finger green branches? Do they then recall
   Intimacies of earth that now they miss,
Rustle of windy branches and the small
   Bird-talk at dawn? Do streets remember this?

Do streets remember, or have they too long
   Been burdened with the weight of life, the press
Of countless footsteps, to call back the song
   Of lark or robin? Does the weariness

From crowded moments crush their dreaming—or
Do streets remember beauty known before?

Double Trouble

For grappling with safety pins,
   In such peculiar poses,
For wiping jelly from their chins
   And butter from their noses,

   And wisdom when it closes
Say, was it I who thought that twins
   Would be a bed of roses!

Do You Remember?

Do you remember?

Do you remember how, one night, we took
   The lantern down and lit it, pulled our coats
About our necks, and went to take a look
   At the new spotted heifer? We had oats

To pacify the mother. I can hear,
   As though it were but yesterday, your laugh,
As you discreetly stroked it:   You said, "Dear,
   It's such a very wobbly little calf!"

Do you remember?

Tonight there will be dinner plates for six
   And candle-light on silver:  You  will move —
The perfect hostess — here and there to fix
   Last minute touches; and I shall approve,

But only faintly:  For I hear  the wind
   Banging our shutters, and, by lantern-light,
I seem to see you rush, undisciplined,
   Out to a small calf bawling in the night.

Do you remember?

Dream House

The little house was lank and lean,
   With weather-beaten seams,
And often from its slim confines
   I planned the house of dreams.

Set high upon the hills of hope,
   Above the winds of chance,
The house of dreams should be a place
Of beauty and romance.

And now its turrets cut the sky,
   Its lawns stretch far and wide,
The house of dreams is mine — but oh,
   There's not a dream inside.

With wistful eyes the years I scan —
   And in my heart I know
My dreams are in the little house
   I lived in long ago.

Dreams And Visions

Out of the past the old dreams came, and stood
Thronging the dark; and every dream was good——-

Secret and lovely. Clothed in borrowed Light,
They moved in beauty on the fringe of night.

Each was a dream of glory that had been.
I reached forth eager hands to take them in,

But all escaped — no least one could I keep:
For dreams, though lovely, are for men asleep.

Out of the future, then, a vision came:
It touched my sleeping soul, and broke in flame

Along the dark. As far as eye could see,
I glimpsed the wonder that is yet to be.

The dreams were fair, but oh, the vision rose,
Single and high — more glorious than those,

More real, more near. I clasped it, with the cry,
"Without a vision, Lord, thy people die!"

* DROUGHT
I

The gaunt trees closer pressed each hungry mouth
   Unto the earth's dry breast, and day by day,
Wasted and worn by weary weeks of drought,
   The lean hills lifted faces, ashen-gray,

Up to the unrepentant sky. The streams
   Long unreplenished from on high, had grown
Frailer and feebler than forgotten dreams,
   Dry gulches yielding only stick and stone.

Beyond the cabin door she saw it all,
   As one who sees, not seeing, for her heart
Beat with a strange new ecstacy:  A small
   Pink bundle stirred beneath the covers — part

Of her and him; and in her flowing breast
There was no drought — only deep joy, sweet rest.

II

From out the long-unanswering skies there swept
   Remorse at last in one bright silver flood.
Up from the startled earth the young green crept.
   Hill, tree and stream drank wonder where each stood;

Three weeks and transformation had its way:
   Slim silver pencils scribbled leaf and flower
Upon an empty page, long waste and gray,
   Leaving the drought a half-remembered hour.

Within the cabin door she sat and stared.
   Her eyes, deep-circled, bore the sombre stain
Of agony; her hungry breast was bared
   Night-long unto the keen cool edge of pain.

Even the new mound in the pasture south
Was turning green. But all her days were drought.

Dual

Two women dwell within my heart,
   Together—and alone;
And one is mistress of herself,
   And one of field and stone.

My first self rises with the clock
   And preens before the glass;
My second, long before the sun.
   Makes footprints in the grass.

The hand of her who molds my charm
   Works well and tirelessly;
My dearer self wastes golden hours
   In making mirth for me.

But spite of all my first can do
   The lines of age make way.
While she who courts the sun and rain
   Is still as young as they.

Two women dwell within my heart,
   And one belongs to Time,
And one belongs to wind and star
   And broken threads of rhyme.

And when they come to burn her,
   My first —- whose life is through —-
A laugh will blow from some far hill,
   "My dear, that wasn't you!"

    Dust

Oh Dust, when I survey thy poor abode,
Behold thee outcast by some wayside road,
Blown on by winds and scattered down the years,
Something in thee my highest self reveres:

I think what part in the infinite plan
Is thine to hold. Thou art to every man
The Alpha and Omega, last and first:
From thee he first drew form, and when the worst

That death is guilty of has come to be,
Through thee he passes to Eternity.
Oh Dust, eternal Dust, that hath withstood
The blight of Time, how oft in careless mood

The hand of man hath lightly dealt with thee
As same lay creature; how relentlessly
Hath fingers, busy with some desk or shelf.
Laid waste the precious atoms of thyself;

Or feet, disdainful of a hidden worth,
Brushed thee aside as simple clods of earth!
Thus "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
Who knows what sacred ashes of the dead

In thee have sought repose; what buried kings,
What fallen statesmen speak; what poet sings;
Or what forgotten heroes, laid to rest,
Feel life resurgent in the quiet breast,

When in the hall of Time some vagrant breeze
Disturbs the sleeping dust of centuries

And scatters it abroad? Along the way
We travel so indifferently, the clay

Of Shakespeare or of Milton may be blown
To intimately mingle with our own.

Perhaps some portion of proud Bonaparte
Lives on in thee, oh Dust; or that great heart

That slept in Lincoln's breast, finds life again
In just such contact with the common men

As thou art fellow to. Oh what a tomb
For buried greatness thou hast been! with rocm

To spare for crumbling leaves and withered flowers,
Trees that have harbored oft the sun and showers

Of passing springs: and bits of splintered stone —
All broken things in Nature hast thou known:

And all earth-creatures, pale and hollow-eyed,
Who pass in dust and know not they have died.

And we, who all too-thoughtless tread above,
Know not what sins we may be guilty of,

What blasphemy is ours, when we deface
This hallowed Dust — their final resting place.

         205

Dust Storm

The earth, a yellow witch gone mad
   With long incessant drouth,
Ifoves in a dizzy dance, and from
   Her gaping, thirsty mouth

She belches words, as hot as flame:
   She flings them to the air.
Dry laughter crackles in her throat
   And leaves but ashes there.

Her reeling form, her scorching words,
   Make madness in the sky;
She twists, and turns, and stabs, and stings,
   And scratches out the eye.

Where are the friendly fields of grass —
   The same earth we have known?
Lie down, lie down, you thirsty witch,
   And leave the sky alone!

She does not hear. She will not stop,
   Though all the lanes of sky
Be clowded with her dusty screams.
   Though every brave thing die.

She cannot cease:  she has gone mad
   With hunger and with heat,
She does not know the place of earth
   Is underneath the feet.

* Duty

Alone, into the beauty
   Of the calm and holy night,
I fled before stern Duty —
   Sought refuge in delight.

But the gold and silver glory
   Of the moon-beams all around
Turned to monsters grim and hoary
   Skirting wildly o'er the ground;

And the cold and silent spaces,
   Stretching far on either side,
Mocked me with an hundred faces
   Of the Duty I denied ————

For the premised dream of beauty
   Brought no swift and sure release...
I went back and faced my Duty
   And, returning, found my Peace.

Easter

The withered plant that sleeps through dreary days,
   Beneath the frozen sod,
Dreams of white blossoms that shall one day rise
   And burst the clod.

The silent bird that shivers in the rain,
   Upon a barren tree,
Keeps in his heart the echo of glad notes
   That are to be.

God plants within each smallest slumbering seed.
   And every captive stream,
The ressurection hope, and winter long,
   Of this they dream.

Then wherefore, heart, be troubled, though the years
   In ceaseless flight, grow dim?
Bright is the Easter premise — ye shall rise
   Complete in Him.

Easter———1938

Because war stalks the earth and man still bleeds,
   Unmindful of the green way of the spring,
Lo, I will make a ritual of seeds.
   Here in a garden plot — remembering

Not so much fragrance, nor the long array
   Of color bursting in bright buds uncurled,
But beauty nineteen hundred years away.
   When One came back who briefly left the world.

I will remember how one garden slept,
   And woke to Ressurection and to Life;
And I will plant a garden, who have kept
   A slender faith to dig with. Out of strife

And turmoil, I will turn and break the sod —
Not just for blocoi, but for the Son of God.


         209

* Easter Conversation

First tuck your tulip bulbs beneath the sod.
   Then make a place for pansies. Did you know,
Dear little boy, that now you work with God?
   He made a garden in the long ago;

He makes all gardens yet. No seed can sprout
   Without His care. He sends the rain, the sun:
No flower wakes and pokes its bright face out
   Unless He guards and cherishes each one.

And did you know that, when His loved ones chose
   A place for Jesus, after He had died,
They found a garden — and from there He rose,
   That first glad Easter morning, glorified?

So make your garden, little boy, each spring:
God gives us gardens — for remembering.

Easter Dawn

"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him." - Mark 16:1

Softly, softly, step so softly.
   We are bent upon
Holy business. Bring the spices.
   Sisters — it is dawn.

Softly, softly, step so softly.
   Are we quite alone?
I remember now — they sealed Him.
   Who will roll the stone?

Softly, softly, step so softly.
   See, the door is wide!
Someone has been here before us.
   Let us go inside.

Softly, softly, step so softly.
   What a cruel shame —
He is gone! Where had they laid Him?
   Someone spoke my name!

Softly, softly, step so softly.
   I am ready now.
Sisters, did you leave without me?
   Master! Is it Thou?

Easter Lilies

How deftly Beauty's fingers work
   To burst the frozen clod
And lift a lily's face, is known
   To no one else but God.

Yet somehow from the crumbling mold
   Of yesterday's decay
Is born the vesture that transcends
   E'en Solomon's array.

How Holiness stoops down to burst
   The iron grip of Hell
And lift a sinner's face to God,
   None but the Christ can tell.

Yet somehow from the black despair
   That turns all glory dim,
The "new man" awakens to become
   God's "righteousness in Him".

Emmanuel

Jack Andrews thinks as you and I:
   That prices must go down,
That streets and shops and millionaires
   Are things that make a town.

Emmanuel wears a strange sad smile:
   Let prices rise or fall,
Of these he thinks not — if indeed
   Emmanuel thinks at all.

He has some very strange new books
   And reads them all the time:
He smiles to see men fight for peace,
   And shakes his head at crime.

Jack Andrews' thoughts advance the world;
   But when they cross the brink,
God may forgive Emmanuel
   For things he does not think.

Encore

At trickery of bow and finger-tips
   We sat aghast, the while he deftly played
The Mendelssohn Concerto; and our lips
   Grew hushed with dreams at Schubert's Serenade;

Bach Air was like a call to holiness;
   The Chopin Nocturne healing for our pain.
And then he played — of infinite caress —
   The Old Refrain.

All that we knew of beauty came to sit
   Like peace upon our shoulders; the slow tides
Of longing brimmed our vision. Bit by bit
   Came back old songs, old faces, old firesides,

Came back our mothers' lips, and, undismayed,
   We lifted ours, for we were home again
After a long, long journey — when he played
   The Old Refrain.

Episode

You held our love between your hands,
As a child holds a toy balloon.
Breath by breath you blew upon it.
And with each breath I watched it expand,
Full, round, perfect.

Then from the depths of your thought,
As a child from the depths of his pockets,
You gathered a handful of words,
Sharp, cruel, relentless.

Each word was a little, bright pin
That you drove in a moment of mischeif
Into the heart of love —
And all that you had created
Vanished into the air,
Leaving it flat and ugly.

Run along, child,
Into the sunshine of life.

There are other balloons
But I — I shall not play again.

         215

Eternal

That night on lone Golgatha's hill.
When shadows settled, dark and still,
Well might the crowd have chattered on:
"The Cross remains——-The Christ is gone."

But we, who know the God of grace,
Can look upon that hallowed place
And know the comfort that sustains:
The Cross is gone — the Christ remains.

Even-Song

Now all the landscape dreaming lies
   And rest to Man is given,
But never sleep the winking stars —
   Those tireless eyes of Heaven;

All night across the vaulted sky
   A countless host they wander,
Or silent glide amongst the clouds
   And quietly dream up yonder.

Here in the dusk, while all things sleep,
   I watch yon pale stars glowing,
And though the shadows fold me close,
   I rest content in knowing

That God above the careless world
   An endless watch is keeping
Through little stars that blink and gleam
   While other eyes are sleeping.

         217

      Evening Song

Love is a book that we have read together....
   Oh, do not close it yet, though well we know
Each dear familiar page. In stormy weather
   We read it by the friendly firelight's glow;

When April walked the world, we read it, drifted
   Inch-deep with petal snow; and when we heard
The lovely lark, our eager faces lifted
   But briefly to the sky—nor lost one word.

Love is a book we shared... .Oh, let us linger
   A little longer with it while we trace
Remembered beauty with each toil-worn finger,
   Touching again this thought, this time, this place

Till sleep shall find us and we let it fall —
Rather than close it, saying, "This is all."

         218

Eventide Song

All things that I have loved in life full well
   Return you to me when the twilight falls.
Like homing pigeons they come back to tell
   How beauty walks the world beyond these walls
And, with it, you — a part of it and more
   Than all of it:   for beauty cannot  go
The last long mile love travels — nor explore
   The secret wonder we have come to know.

Nor time, nor distance, nor the need for touch,
   Can now divide us: we have gone beyond
These limitations, who have loved so much.
   Without a word, a handclasp to respond,
You come with twilight, and the fading sun.
   This is to love you — this is to be one.

Except Ye Become As Little Children


"It's just a little way", he said,
   "To Jesus' house, you know,
And not so very long to wait" —
   Dear child, who told him so?

"She's only just gone on ahead.
   And we are going, too;
We'll see her up at Jesus' house."
   I wonder how he knew!

Oh, Lord, forgive our feeble faith
   That always asks to see;
And thank Thee for a little child
   To lead us tip to Thee.

Expectant

Does Mother Earth, I wonder, know
   What sleeps beneath her heart
Throughout the Ancient Miracle
   Of which she is a part?

Or does she also speculate
   And sometimes wish she knew:
A Blackeyed Susan? Or two eyes
   Of bright cornflower blue?

A tall and sturdy hollyhock?
   Or dainty Queen Ann's lace?
The gold of dandelion hair?
   A pansy's baby face?

Does Mother Earth, I wonder know
   Just what the seed will be —
Or must she wait her time, as I
   With hushed expectancy?

* Expendable For God

Let me but be expendable for God,
   Not longing for the tumult and the strife.
Strong winds obey His will — so does the clod
   That lies inert and holds the germ of life.
This simple clod, mere dust beneath the feet,
   Another Spring will quicken into flower.
With like obedience my heart would meet
   The quiet challenge of this lonely hour.

Let me but rest within my Father's will —
   No doubt, no questioning, no vain desire.
He understands it all, come good or ill.
   This life has been invested:   I aspire
To nought beyond the present's narrow rim —
   Only to be expendable for Him.

Small, white lamb in the field.
Child in the garden,
Humming-bird passing
In swift fantastic flutter
Of frenzied wings,
Be careful how you scatter it,
The life that is in you,
Capering
Running
Beating the air with it.
I too was young once,
A long time ago.

* Faithful And Fruitful

Faithful and fruitful I would be —
   But oh, how weak is the flesh!
Holy Spirit, I come to Thee:
   Touch me, fill me afresh.

Faithful and fruitful? Who can hope,
   Alone, to reach such a goal?
Holy Spirit, I falter, grope —
   Cleanse me, strengthen, control.

Faithful and fruitful only when
   Bereft of self I shall be.
Holy Spirit, annoint me — then
   The faith, the fruit, are of Thee.

    Fallen Aviator

He cried for the moon when a baby,
   Lifting his small hands high;
They mocked his young presumption
   And countered, "Let him cry."

He cried for the moon, and he found it
   Once in a far, still place:
Alone he lay and held it
   All night upon his face.

He cried for the moon, and they mocked him:
   Does he who was born to try
Wings for the great adventure
   Now counter, "Let them cry?"

Out of heaven something fell;

      Fantasy

The day is a giant.
I have seen him riding upon the hill-tops,
Booted and spurred,
Proud in the armor of morning.
I have watched the sunlight
Glint on his bridle and helmet
Making him gorgeous and splendid;
I have heard the hoofs of his charger
And the long, long stride of their coming,
Terrible, swift, relentless.
The day is a giant
Riding upon the edge of the world.

The night is a little black slave,
I have seen him, stricken with terror,
Running before the day,
Helpless, bewildered:
Soft is the sound of his going,
Footsteps that sink in the star-dust,
Timid, uncertain.
The night is a little black slave
Fleeing before the giant.

And yet —

If morning found me alone
Upon a high hill-top
Where I could hear the Day
Galloping, galloping,

I should not turn to the giant
Eyes that were frightened and pleading,
Straight in the path of his coming
I should stand as a grim wall stands —
And laugh in his face.

But if, in the hush of the twilight,
A little black slave should whisper
Softly, persistent,
Brushing my cheek with dreams
Kinder than hands are,
If I heard through the stretches of silence
The patter of footsteps that vanish,
And felt the breath of the night
Trembling upon me
Out of the covert of darkness,

I should run, I should run!

Farewell To Sixty-Sixth

We've had a lot of happiness within this dear old school;
We tried to master many things, and make of each a tool.

How often, in the years ahead, we will turn back and sigh—
Remembering the day we stood, to say our last goodbye.

Chorus: Farewell to Sixty-Sixth,
   We will be true,
   Wherever we may go,
   We'll think of you;

   Whatever life may bring,
   One thing we know—-
   This is the garden where
   We learned to grow.

The sun comes up, the sun goes down; but, speeding on its way,
The sun is always hastening to bring another day;

So, whether here, or whether there, beyond the farther hill,
Remember—when you think of us—we shall be shining still.

Chorus:  Farewell to  Sixty-Sixth,
    We will be true,
    Wherever we may go,
    We'll shine for you;

    Whatever life may bring,
    One thing we know—-
    This is the garden where
    We learned to grow.

Farewell

(Dedicated to our Pastor and read by the author at the meeting
of Presbytery held in Pasadena, Tuesday, March 10, 1942, at
which time the request of the Rev. L. David Cowie for dissolution
of the pastorate between himself and the Vermont Avenue Pres-
byterian Church was concurred).

He asked us to dissolve the pastorate:
   Now didn't he know better than to ask
A thing like that of simple folk? 'Twould rate
   More than a miracle for such a task.

You can't dissolve the ties of love that bind
   A pastor to his people. We will let
Him go——-because he asks it——-but he'll find.
   Day after day that he is with us yet.

He touched our lives and made them beautiful
   With Christ. His every sermon came to be
A pebble dropped into a silent pool,
   Whose ripples spread to fringe eternity.

These are the facts, and what is there to say?
   What is expected of us anyhow?
With words you can't explain the truth away —
   You can't say, "This HAS been, but isn't now."

Now, as for God, HIS way is perfect:   So
   When God is calling, we must all obey;
Yet even God, who says that he must go,
   Knows, in a larger sense, that he must stay.

He will be here in youthful eyes that learned,
   Through his clear sight, more perfectly to see;
In aged forms, whose captive spirits yearned
   To know the Truth — and found it made them free!

O, you can take away the well-loved face,
   The brilliant mind, in which we placed great stock;
But you cannot dissolve the work of grace
   That binds THIS man forever to THIS flock.

He will be ours, wherever he may roam,
   As seasons change, and wheels of time revolve;
He built himself an everlasting home
   Within our hearts....and that you can't dissolve.

Farm Album: Girl At The Pasture Bars

She dropped her hand upon the pasture bars;
   Briefly it lay, a slender gleam of white.
I saw her lift her eyes unto the stars,
   As though she asked a question of the night.
Slowly she gathered stillness to herself
   And wrapped it gracefully about her form....
Oh I shall keep this picture on a shelf
   Of memory forever:  it shall warm.

Dull days of drab endeavor. Who would guess
   The simple act of driving cattle could
Be fraught with such exquisite loveliness,
   Or that so many grander pictures would
Be tossed from Time, replaced by this small one —
A young girl dreaming when the day is done?

Farm Album: Boy At The Woodpile

His dogged footsteps grew a little lax
   The while he climbed the hill and crossed the yard;
But when he grasped the handle of the ax
   There came into his being something hard
And fierce. The light of conquest in his eye,
   He howed a straight course to the very core
Of every log. I watched the bright chips fly
   And knew he conquered worlds beyond his door.

So dull the ax blade and so brief his strength,
   It seemed but folly to rely on such.....
And yet, how often I shall glimpse the length
   Of his gaunt shadow with me, and shall touch
Again this farm-boy, cutting clean and true,
Straight at the heart of what he had to do.

Farm Album: Old Man AT The Well

The old man let the battered bucket down
   And leaned his elbows on the well's cool brink.
And some there were who thought he came to frown;
   But some there were who knew he came to drink,
Not of this water but of other things:
   The lazy length of sumners he had known.
Stark winters, burnished autumns, other springs,
   And all the sons and daughters that were grown.

Though well he knew that anything so small
   As his tin bucket could not hold the half
Of those lost dreams, he would not move till all
   Remembrance was accomplished..... I shall quaff,
With all bright waters in each future place,
The long, long story written on his face.

Father of Science

Galileo, how could you know
So many things, so long ago?

A swaying lamp could "go and come":
And make you see a pendulum.

For distant stars your mind would grope
Until you dreamed a telescope.

While other people had their fun
You found the sunspots on the sun.

And while they rattled dish and spoon,
You saw the mountains on the moon.

And all the moons that travel 'round
The planet Jupiter, you found,

So many things, remote and strange:
How Venus' shape would seem to change;

How many million stars unite
To give the Milky Way its light.

Father of Science, I think I know
What made you wise so long ago:

You never could sit down and wait —
You simply must investigate!

Right now, beyond our sight and sound,
Are wonders waiting to be found.

How very much we need today
Inquiring minds to lead the way.

Father of Science, help us see
The many marvels yet to be!

      Fellowship

Then I remember how He toiled to bring
   His healing ministry to all who came,
When I recall His lonely suffering
   In dark Gethsemane, the cruel shame
Of death by crucifixion — then I turn
    From something in myself that always sighs
For easy comforts; then indeed I spurn
    The pleasant pastures and the cloudless skies.

How do I dare to speak of gain or loss.
    Of flimsy favors I might hope to win,
When He has borne the anquish of the Cross?
    Dear Son of God, so smitten for my sin!
I choose the path His bleeding feet have known.
How could I walk another road — alone?

* First Christmas

Choose a very tiny tree,
   With a single star:
There was one that other night,
   Shining bright and far.

Choose a little, woolly lamb,
   With a music box:
There were shepherds on that night,
   Watching over flocks.

Let it play a lullaby,
   Soft and sweet and mild,
Such as Mary might have sung
   To the sleeping child.

Many Christmases will be
   Full of fuss and fret.
Let them wait — he is so small:
   Please — not yet, not yet!

First Day of School

At last they have departed.
   What is wrong?
This is the day I prayed for,
   Sumner long.

This is the boon by mothers
   Coveted,
A time to shout. Why do I
   Mope instead?

Why do I dream and dawdle,
   Sit and stare,
And listen for the noise that
   Isn't there?

       First Love

Out of Bear Hollow a lone cry steals,
A cry that is moving along on wheels,
And gathering volume, to lift and flout
Itself on space, with a mighty shout.

He knows how the little fawn will lie
Close in the covert while it goes by;
He knows how the frightened birds will wheel
Over that mass of swaying steel.

He knows it all:   how his own shy heart
Will go stark wild, and his eyes will smart,
His head grow hot, and his hands grow numb —
But still he must watch the dark thing come.

In years to be he will make a choice
Of girsl he knows, and her patient voice
Will almost suit him — but never quite.
When time is a huddle of day and night,

And out of the hollow it comes, he'll stand,
A foaming bucket in either hand,
Searching dusk with a wishful glance
For his first — and maybe — his last romance.

* Finding

The house oppressed with heavy weight of gloom;
   More still than thought the stealthy silence crept
In circles 'round, until my troubled room
   Became a sea of emptiness. I wept —
I wept for you, — the words you might have said.
   Your fresh young laughter floating on the air;
And then for very loneliness I fled,
   Running into the night with my despair.

Lightly you came across the dreaming down:
   You were the wind that trembled at my face,
You were a white star brooding on the town,
   And you were sea-mist drifting into space....
Long moments then I stood, nor even stirred —
Holding a dream more sweet than any word.

    First Love

A girl's heart is a very private place:
   Her first love seldom is the boy next door,
The lanky one with freckles on his face,
   Though he may often think he is. Before
She knows of his existence, there is one
   To whom her heart is given, who will be
Her measure of a man. She knows that none
Can every be so brave, or wise, as he.

She loves an older man, and all her life
   She keeps a comer of her heart for him;
And even when she is a loving wife,
   If she should hear his name her eyes may brim
With sudden tears. But, try to understand —
Her father was the first to hold her hand!

* First Pussy Willow

Step up lightly,
   Still and quick! —
Spring has fastened
   On a stick.

Wearing still
   Her winter hood,
Spring has crept
   Into the wood.

In her little
   Furry blouse,
Crept us softly
   As a mouse.

Now beside
   The frozen stream
Soft gray garments
   Sway and gleam.

Nature magic,
   What a trick! —
Spring has fastened
   On a stick.

Flight

I have come hone to stay with you again,
   Who have been gone a long, long journeying:
Walking with weeping alders in the rain,
   Chasing a butterfly on gusty wing;
I have climbed mountain-peaks, where shining crags
   Beckoned with sunlight, I have dipped the face
Deeply into the heart of purple flags
   Lining a rock-pool in some secret place;

There were green country lanes that I went down,
   Where wild grape tangled with the snowy plum.
I have been gone a long while from this town,
   Oh, long enough for you to wake and thumb
Five pages through, and doze again — for me
To spread the cloth, light candles for our tea.

* For All.......Christmas.....Forever

Of old a white star led the way
To where the little Christ Child lay.
The green tree is the symbol now
Of all the star meant:   Every bough
To which the bright adornments cling
Is weighted with remembering.

The children of the world all stand,
Each holding tip an empty hand....
Feeling the need of something far,
Secret, and shining, as a star:
Something to reach for and to press
Against this hour of loneliness.

O, God of Christmas, God of love,

Who stooped to earth from heaven above,
Be pleased to bend above our tree
And light, anew, for all to see,

The star of Faith that shall recall
Christmas forever.....and for all.

For A Young Christian

There is magic in the moonlight.
   There is wonder in the why
That the morning gilds the hilltops
   With the promise of the day;

There is glory in a garden
   When the dawn has just begun
And the sunbeams all are sifted
   Like rose petals, one by one.

But there is no earthly splendor
   That can ever quite compare
With a yielded young life showing
   That the hand of God is there.

* Forest Silence

Beneath the peace of forest sanctity
    The hills lie silent as forgotten tombs,
Asleep in calm and grave solemnity.
    No learned lips pronouncing ancient dooms
May here intrude, nor any echo find
    Its way along these halls where late hath fled
The shy soft footsteps of the forest wind.
    Here broods the quiet of the buried dead.

And here is holiness, remote and rare
    As hidden wings that pass and then are still,
It touches trees and hovers in the air
    Till Beauty walks upon each sleeping hill.
And silence in so frail a mold is cast,
I fear — I fear the wonder cannot last!

Forest Twilight

Do not speak to me now.
Do not move:
Something stirs in the bough
   Above,

Something creeps through the brush;
   Do not start:
Let us stand in the hush,
   Apart;

Let us wait for the sound
   To increase,
Moving close to the ground,
   And cease.

Let us hear, through the dark,
   Little feet
Scratching claws on the bark,
   Retreat.

Do not speak to me lest
   We should miss
Something. Day was a quest
   For this.

    Four-Year Old

When she walks she does not walk
   As the grown-ups do:
Music twitches at her toes,
   Laughter lifts her shoe.

Lifts it up and puts it down
   Twinkle-swift as rain,
Lifts it up and runs with it
   And puts it down again.

She is like a butterfly
   Dancing in the sun,
When she walks she cannot walk —
   Her feet must skip and run.

        Frames

That loveliness may be encompassed, man,
   With artistry of thought, devised the frame
To hold a picture. But a better plan
   My window gives me:  here the very same
Enclosure frames two pictures, for I see
   Outside today a sidewalk splashed with rain,
A wild wet world; but who looks in at me
   Sees warmth and comfort through the window-pane.

Love is a frame, reversible like this,
   Through it you look at me and I at you.
If for you falls discouragement, dismiss
   The thought, Beloved, raise your eyes, look through
The window-frame of love — and find a place
Of peace and shelter in my lifted face.

*   Freedom

Today we took our hunger to the hills,
   Our lean heart-hunger that, for Beauty's sake,
Had borne through crowded days an hundred ills,
   But durst no longer. "Lest our spirits break"
I said, "Beloved, let us leave it all,
   Laugh in the sun and for one hour be
Tall as the top-most hill we climb is tall,
   Free for a moment as the wind is free."

A wonder met us where the trees began —
   And I was Pippa playing with a song,
The shepherd David you — or was it Pan?
   What matter? In that hour, all we long
To know we captured, all our hunger craves.
We shall go back to toil — but not as slaves.

      Friendship Garden

She lingers alone in the twilight
   And fingers the roses with pride,
For this is her Garden of Friendship —
   She calls it her "beauty outside."

But we, who have known her and loved her,
   Are sure that no rose could begin,
For sweetness and grace of demeanor,
   To compare with her beauty within.

The beauty of patience and courage.
   Triumphant, whatever the test;
The beauty of humble submission,
   Acknowledging God's way is best.

I too have a Garden of Friendship
   Where flourish, so straight and so tall,
The bravest I've known among women —
   But she overtowers than all.

Fruition

Like worn old women with their bearing over
   The fallow fields dream all day in the sun;
No more they stir to whispers in the clover,
   No more they sway where ripened ripples run
Along the wheat. Though hills come down to meet them
   Beyond the fence, with talk of trees, they seem
To lift no single grass blade up to greet them,
   But lie in lazy lengths, content to dream.

So rests the heart that has known love's fruition:
   Untouched by change, unmoved by circumstance.
Beyond desire. Secure in the position
   That, after all life's fever and romance,
There yet are dreams, contentment clean and sweet:
The harvest gathered and the task complete.

      254

* Fugitive

My thoughts are lone gulls flying far
   Across a winter sea;
A safe shore-line where snug nests are
   Is not for me.

My thoughts are lone gulls borne along
   Out through a troubled night,
The cadence of their wings a song;
   A blur of light.

I cannot call my lone thoughts back
   To smug security;
The coctmon days, the beaten track,
   Are not for me.

Like to a wam-out garment, cast aside,

As, moving through the darkness, far and -wide,
   A rising tide of song began to swell.

Song after song came crowding to be heard,
   Till heaviness was lost is ecstasy——
And all earth's faces vanished and were blurred
   In one Face, strangely beautiful to see.

For all the songs are one song, and the face
   Is one Face only, when the heart has known
The matchless Christ and His redeeming grace.
   There cannot be another:  He alone

Moves on the fringe of all our nights and days—
And clothes us with the grament of His praise.

    Gates

I have gone through a lifetime of gates open wide
   And gates that were hard to undo,
But I only remember, when night settled down.
   The gate that I never went through.

The gates that walked into green fields I forget
   And those that unveiled oceans blue,
But I always keep wondering what lay beyond
   The gate that I never went through.

Perhaps little dreams that have died would have lived
   And maybe the false would be true,
And age might be youth—if my hand had unlocked
   The gate that I never went through.

    Gift For Christmas

What can I give to men whose empty eyes
   Trouble my thinking at this Christmastide?
Lord make me humble, loving, strong and wise,
   That I may give them Christ, the crucified.
Let me not choose the lesser gifts of earth,
   That pass in dust and are futility:
Lord, at this sacred season of Thy birth,
   Lead me from giving things to giving Thee.

What can I give to Thee, oh God, above?
   (There is so little that our God could need)
And yet, in all my dreams, Thy heart of Love
   Is wounded still:   I see it break and bleed
With naught to staunch the flow — except I bring
   Some ransomed soul, called home from wandering.

    Give Me Some Mountains

Give me some mountains, for my heart is weary
    Of field and fence, of houses in a row,
Of gray rain falling desolate and dreary,
   Of naked trees etched dark against the snow.
Give me some mountains, far and high and splendid,
   Some little hills to snuggle at their feet:
When dawn is breaking and the long night ended
   Give me a place where earth and heaven meet.

Give me some mountains, this is all too little:
   The level land, the neat concentric lives.
With pies to bake, with sticks to carve and whittle.
   Day after day the lonely spirit strives
To fit the pattern—but these tears belie it.
   Give me some reaching-up, some strength to try it.

* God's Afterward — And Now

"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous....nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby." - Hebrews 12:11

God's afterward—how sweet it is
   To know He holds my hand,
And some day, in His afterward,
   This heart will understand!

This heart will know why tears must fall,
   As raindrops drench the earth,
Why winter always must precede
   The springtime's gladsome birth.

God's afterward will be replete
   With joy for every pain,
Like morning coming after night,
   Or sunshine after rain.

I thank Him for His afterward,
   In gratitude I bow;
But I can wait——-1 am content
   To know He holds me now.

* God Comfort You

"Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God." - II Corinthians 1:4

God comfort you, that you may comfort those
   Who know like sorrow when your tears are dried.
There is no heartbreak but the Savior knows:
   He understands and cares. No faith is tried
Beyond its measure. As the falling rain
   Reclothes the barren bough, so may your grief
Reach out beyond the sharp, thin edge of pain
To find the bud, the blossom and the leaf.

God comfort you, that all your years may bring
   Rich harvest to a sorrow-laden world.
Within your heart, where now the bright tears cling;
   The seed of something wonderful lies curled:
Compassion's flower for the ones who may
   Walk, in the future, where you walk today.

     God Gave His Son

God gave His Son — and we must give Him too.
   Though carols sound from every crowded store,
Though chimes ring out along the avenue
   And every heart seems lighter, there is more:
This is not Christmas that we hear and feel,
   This sudden glow that comes to everyone:
The season can be only vital, real,
   Because God loved — and gave His only Son.

God loved, and we must love the troubled throng:
   Look deep within their hearts and see their need
Of something more than atmosphere, than song;
   Of something larger, even, than a creed.
This is the task that Christians have to do.
   God gave His Son — and we must give Him too.

God gave us ears, because there would be music:
Great symphonies of wind and sea, and small
Bright bird notes falling, instruments and voices;
He gave us ears that we might hear them all.

God gave us eyes, because there would be beauty:
Brown summer fields, all green and tender springs,
Fall's pageantry and winter's long white silence;
He gave us eyes to look upon these things.

God gave us hands, because there would be labor:
Small simple tasks, and great ambitious schemes
Wrought out in steel, or marble, or on canvas;
He gave us hands with which to shape our dreams.

God gave us hearts, because there would be longing
To share with those around and Him above,
The beauty and the music and the labor.
He gave us hearts—because there would be love.

        God Keeps A Pear Tree

All through the long, dark, dreary days, the same
   Monotonous drab landscape met my view
Beyond the window pane, until there came
   A pear tree suddenly. And then I knew

How winter-long it was for this, for this,
   The window waited, confident and sure,
To frame this glory, to receive this kiss
   Of petals drifting, delicate and pure.

God keeps a pear tree for earth's darkest hour,
   Somewhere, somewhere beyond the time of loss,
Its white fulfillment fragilely in flower.
   God keeps a pear tree just to lift and toss

Its ghostly branches, just to stand and bless
With peace and comfort all the comfortless.

God Is Calling You

From life's conflict and confusion,
   God is calling you:
Earthly dreams are but delusion,
   God is calling you;
Through the world of His designing,
   By the stars forever shining,
In the dark cloud's silver lining,
   God is calling you.

Chorus:

God is calling, God is calling.
   Through the darkness of the night —
Hear His gently accents falling;
   "Come to Christ, who is the Light."
By His love, that knows no measure,
   To a life completely new,

To an Everlasting Treasure —
   God is calling, calling you.
From your sining and your sorrow,
    God is calling you;
To a beautiful tomorrow,
    God is calling you.

Out of trials that surround you,
    From the problems that confound you,
By His wonders all around you,
    God is calling you.
To the glory of redemption
    God is calling you:

On your life He has preemption,
    God is calling you.
Every thing in His creation
    Now awaits that consummation —
To the beauty of Salvation,
    God is calling you.

God's Gate of Love

God comes to those who need Him most,
   He fills the heart that trusts His grace
For all the lonely, and the lost,
   At Calvary God made a place.

Chorus:

At Calvary, where Jesus died,
   God's gate of love stands open wide;

Now all, who trust, from sin are free —
   God dries all tears at Calvary.

When shadows fall God waits to bless,
   When storms arise He says, "Be still!"
Weep not for all life's emptiness:
   The cluttered heart He cannot fill.

When clouds engulf and skies are gray,
   God holds the sunshine in His hands:
Christ is the Light, the Truth, the Way,
   Oh come to Him — He understands.

God Loves You

When you think that all is lost,
   God loves you:

He has proved it at such costs,
   God loves you.

Jesus left His home on high,
   Came to earth that He might die —

He will never pass you by:
   God loves you, God loves you!

For your sake the Savior died,
   God loves you;

Heaven's gate is open wide,
   God loves you.

By His grace all things are new,
   There is nothing left to do —

Christ has done it all for you:
   God loves you, God loves you!

Though your soul be stained with sin,
   God loves you;

Jesus died your soul to win,
   God loves you,

Come to Him, oh do not wait,
   Lest tanorrow be too late —

Sinner, do not hesitate:
   God loves you, God loves you.

God's Love

However dark the night may be,
There is a Light from Calvary.
A Light that shines around, above,
The Light of God's eternal love.

Chorus:

The love of God is like a star,
It shines on you just where you are;
The darkest night cannot erase
The love of God, nor change His grace.

When earthly loves have ceased to be,
When time becomes eternity.
More fresh and pure than morning dew,
The love of God will still be new.

Though lost in sin, though clothed with shame,
It was for you the Savior came:
However far your feet may roam,
The love of God still calls you home.

Can you ignore, can you neglect,
Can you deny, can you reject,
The Light that shines from one dark Hill,
The Light that says, God loves you still?

God's Treasure

God has a treasure, boundless in measure,
He wants to give it away:
Christ has revealed it, God's Spirit sealed it
Won't you accept it today?

Chorus:

Won't you take the Treasure,
Won't you make it yours?
Christ the Lord is waiting,
Gently He implores;

Angels up in heaven
Look with longing too ——
When they start rejoicing,
Let it be for you!

Jesus, by dying, ended our trying,
Now we are saved by His grace:
All who believe it, gladly receive it,
One day may look on His face.

All through the ages one theme engages
Saints in the glory above:
Anthems are swelling, constantly telling
Only of Christ and His love.

God With Us

In the carpenter shop of Joseph
There was more than the bright tools made;
Sometimes a Song in the silence,
Or a Light where the young Lad played.

In the home of Mary and Martha
There was more than the guest who came:
Sometimes a Voice in the darkness,
Or out of the shadow, Flame.

In the judgement hall of Pilate
There was more than a man forsooth:
There was a Peace and a Presence——
And the Answer to "What is truth?"

He knows the day

When shadows fall
   I'll trust His grace:
God knows it all —-
   One day I'll see His face.

God understands
   What is to be,
Within His hands
   He holds the key.

When life shall end
   I'll trust His grace:
God is my friend —
   One day I'll see His face.

God never fails:
   When day grows dark
He'll set the sails,
   He'll guide the bark.

When I explore
   The whole of grace —
I'll ask no more
   Than just to see His face.

Go Ye Into All The World

"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes." - John 21:6

How many millions alien to grace,
   Will pass into a lost eternity,
The while we fish in the accustomed place!
   Launch out, launch out into the farther sea!

The oft repeated message scarcely wakes
   The lazy listeners, who dose and nod
While countless numbers perish — for whose sakes
   The Saviour died. Give them the Word of God!

"For God so loved the world." Not just the few
   Who by good fortune have the chance to hear
In quiet church and comfortable pew
   The story, week by week, and year by year.

Christ's great commission is the simple call,
"Go Ye." The Gospel is for all, for all.

Speed, winged hours, and hasten that far day
   When wrinkled Time shall burden us with age:
We flinch not—youth is sweet, but all its way
   Is but the preface to that greater page

Where soon, (how soon!) to us shall be revealed
   The mysteries of Life. We may not guess
What truths, what golden wisdoms lie concealed
   Behind the years that fringe youth's happiness.

Speed, winged hours, and if the future bring
   Too much of pain, too little of the old
Wild joy that first we knew, remembering
   Is comfort often when the best is told;

And wisdom shall be ours; and we shall trade
Reality for dreams that cannot fade.

Timothy, Timothy, when you were three
Did Grandmother Lois take you on her knee?

Did Grandmother Lois look into your face,
And was she the first one to speak of His grace?

And was she the first one to tell why He came,
The first one to teach you to lisp out His name?

For slow buds bursting one by one,

For moonlight drifting from the place
   Of clouds high-banked,
To show a chaste and lovely face;
   For morning dew and cobweb lace,

Now God be thanked.

   And hard to please
With ccomon comforts, daily food,
   Lord, send white daybreak through the wood

I'm on my knees.

Gray Lady (The Red Cross worker)

She does not sing of beauty now:  her days
Have grown too full of countless ministries.
An alien, down dear remembered ways,
She walks as one who neither hears nor sees
The meadow-lark, the clean slant of the sail,
The vagrant petal drifting with the wind;

No longer lured by every winding trail.
She does not sing of beauty:   But  her touch
Is full of all the beauty she has known,
Light winds, cool raindrops; the fevered clutch
Feebly at her to make her peace their own.
And some there are who miss her songs; but some
Who know she need not sing.......She has become.

Great Mind In The Crowd

The silent isolation of great peaks
Was suddenly upon us when you
Strolling into our conmon days and weeks.
We could have coped with brilliance, but our shame

Was naked at your silence. You could say
More words than we had thought of, but you stood
Remote and let our small minds have their way,
And smiled, no doubt, to see we thought they could.

You were as near as voices and a touch,
As close as firelight; yet you were as far
As some great ice-berg in the frozen clutch
Of that long night beneath the polar star.

Flesh of our flesh, of bone and brawn our kind,
But alien forever in the mind.

Greatness

There is a greatness that is not achieved.....
   A thing apart from any glorious deed.......
It is the greatness of brave hearts that bleed,
   Yet wear a smile for human wrongs received;

The greatness of old trees that long long have grieved
   O'er too-forgetful leaves their roots must feed,
Yet make no murmur to the gossip weed
   But cast their shade that man may be relieved.

The greatness of endeavor comes or goes
   By conscious effort. Here is something more:
A quiet greatness that just grows and grows,
   Root, stalk and branch, out of the very core

Of life. And he who wears it never knows
He has the thing most men are searching for.

Great Thoughts You Weary Me

Great thoughts you weary me,
Dignified and stem,
Coming in your robes of state,
Urging me to learn.

Serious and scholarly,
Gray heads in a row;
Great thoughts you weary me.
You weary me so!

I have need of little thoughts,
Intimate and kind:
Footsteps of departing leaves,
Laughter of the wind,

Shy white fingers of the rain
Creeping through my hair,
And the breath of waking buds
And blossoms in the air.

I have been so long from these,
A prisoner with books.
Almost I do forget the stars
And how a robin looks!

Great thoughts I cannot stay;
There is that in me
Which thirsts to taste the sea-fog's lips,
Which hungers for a tree!

I am tired of being wise;
Let me rise and go
To those who little knowledge have
And little need to know.

There will be double exemption

We have his solemn promise,

"You can make all you want, kids,
   After you're seventy-two."

Chorus:

Why should we cry about it?
    Surely it could be worse:
Change in the years before us
    Means change in our empty purse.

When you are five and sixty
   And I am seventy-two.

And though she longed for licorice,

The hated green thing in her hand,
    She turned from north to south,

But after every side was scanned,

No one but God could issue such commands:
   He, only, holds the key to certainty;
And yet, he places it within our hands
   With just these simple words, "Believe in Me."

Blot out the stars, erase the oceans, thrust
   The universe aside — one thing endures:
The Word of God. In that the heart can trust.
   Have faith in God. His blessed Book assures

The faithful that to ask is to receive;
Not one is turned away who will believe.

No day with Him is desolate or dreary:

I trust His grace for every dark tomorrow —

   To execute His will:
When tempests tossed a tiny ship,
   He just said, "Peace, be still."

When those who should have known Him best
   Released a startled cry,
He did not turn to miracles,

The highways of the world are straight and broad,

Choose wisely, soul:   The  highway to our God
   Leads past the wellspring of eternal life.

The signposts of the world may lead astray,
   The profits that they premise prove but loss;
But he who finds the Life, the Truth, the Way,
   Need only heed the signpost of the Cross.

The highways of the world are all ablaze
   With neon lights. God's highway has but one:
Sufficient light for all earth's nights and days
   The heart can find in God's beloved Son.

And by that Light, down little lanes of love,
   The heart can move to heal the world's distress;
Until at last, in God's great home above,
   We dwell with Him, who is our righteousness.

The mellow light now lingers on the land:
    It is the twilight time. The golden grain
Lies stacked and ready; and the com shocks stand
    Like sentinels against the coming rain;

On withered vines the pumpkins loose their hold:
    A shiver in the com stalks seems to tell
That winter's hands now reach for sunnier's gold.
    This is the earth's bright yield. Oh, guard it well.

It is the twilight time in other fields.
    Now ripe unto the hardest. Send the Word:
For winter comes; and night. The present yields
    Eternal increase — these must know the Lord.

The fields are white — the laborers are few.

The harvest of indifference is theirs;

Heart, build a fire against the night.
   Against the time of chill,
When winter woods stand stark and white,
   When earth is cold and still.

Heart, build a fire and feed it'well,
   Far, sooner than it seems,
Age leaves us with a hollow shell
   Of empty, broken, dreams.

Heart, build a fire of love and faith
   Against the time of storm:
When all things vanish, just the wraith
   Of these will keep us warm.

Have Faith in God

"Immovable as mountains," men will say —
   And yet our God says, "Faith the size of one
Snail mustard seed: will be enough to sway
   A mountain, if we say to it, "Begone."

No one but God could issue such commands:
   He, only, holds the key to certainty;
And yet, he places it within our hands
   With just these simple words, "Believe in Me."

Blot out the stars, erase the oceans, thrust
   The universe aside — one thing endures:
The Word of God. In that the heart can trust.
   Have faith in God. His blessed Book assures

The faithful that to ask is to receive;
Not one is turned away who will believe.

       He's Coming Again

The Lord is soon coming, with shout from on high —
Those who believe will never die!
Accept Him as Saviour and join Him above,
The King of the Kingdom of Love.

REFRAIN:

He's coming again, in the clouds of the air,
For those who have faith to receive Him:
He told of a day when we' 11 meet Him up there —
Oh wonderful day! I believe Him!

And deep in my heart there is planted a song,
That echoes all day, though the way may be long:
"He's coming again. He's caning again,
He's coming again, my Lord Jesus!"

The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall arise —
They who believed, they who were wise! —
Then we who remain will be caught up with than.,
To meet with Lord of the skies.

The Great Tribulation today may begin:
Kingdoms will fall, life will be grim;
Oh why will you linger? Repent of your sin
And spend your forever with Him!

Though shadows may lengthen and midnight descend,
Do not lose faith, life will not end:
Make ready to meet Him — the Groom will soon come
To take His beloved Bride home!
           301

He Passes

He passes. Let the voice of song be hushed
   A little time. Within the saddened heart
Let only dreams of music that he brushed
   From strings, now silent, wake again and start;

Bring to this place no verbal offering
   Of melody. The master plays no more:
Lay down the bow, Life is a broken string —
   And silence fitting tribute at Death's door.

He passes. For a time be still.......And then
   From hands that learned of him to wield the bow,
Let there be song, and in the lives of men
   Let there be strength that his life taught to grow;

Let us go forward frcm the place of tears
To carry beauty down the troubled years.

He Who Creates

Within his heart there is a lonely place
   Where even love dare not intrude: like some
Pale star that floats upon the rim of space,
   Remote and unapproachable. There come

To this still place no tender word, no touch,
   No shared rememberings, no dream discussed.
Though two may love and long, however much,
   One enters here alone — because he must.

Beside the deep and limpid pool of thought
   One stoops, alone, and kneels; and takes away
The word, the song, the truth that must be taught
   The burning beauty for the common day.


None other goes with him, nor great, nor small.
But what he brings away he brings for all.
         303

Hiding Place

The quick tears fell, close pressed the laurel boughs.
   Cool was the earth unto a child's hot face:
With small hands clenched I sobbed, "Oh little house
   Shut in by leaves, you are my hiding place."

There often, fresh from punishment, I came
   And flung myself, face down, upon the fern,
Buried the eyes to hide my weepings' shame,
   Learning the first hard truths a child must learn.

Oh Heart, where can we run for hiding now
   From prying eyes, where sob the lone grief out?
No little leaf leans low, no laurel bough
   Stoops down to screen. These city walls are stout,

But oh, they cannot shut man's secret ills
Away from pitys gaze - that takes the hills.

* Hills Have No Envy

Hills have no envy, not the shadowed peace
   Of quiet valleys, nor the blue expanse
Of sunlit waters woos them, no wild geese
   Winging the trackless heavens for romance.

Hills have been set too long 'twixt earth and sky
   To know desire; their years of gamering
Have yielded satisfaction: for the tie
   That binds contentment in remembering.

Hills have no envy. Though the brunt of storms
   Age-long they bear, this high thought lifts them up,
Runs like a fire through all their being, warms
   Their confidence and makes a brimming cup

Of barren years:   since first the dawn of Time
Hills have been man's encouragement to climb.

* His Face

"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." - II Corinthians 4:6

When once, upon life's pathway,
   The face of Christ appears,
How little all our laughter,
   How transient all our tears!

The things we thought important
   Are only fragments blown
To vanish in the distance.
   When once the Lord is known.

How tawdry is earth's tinsel!
   When Jesus takes His place,
The end of all seeking
   Is written in one Face.

How Much More God

Man spends his strength on grainte and on steel.
He builds his structures reaching for the sky.
Above their puny pretense, quite alone,
The timeless mountains stand aloof and high.

Man writes his name in symphony and song,
Along the path where weary mortals plod
He seeks articulation. There remains
More music in the silences of God.

Man flings his feeble flutters into space
And prides himself on progress and on change.
The silent stars, eternities away,
Maintain their secret orbs remote and strange.

Man breaks the alabaster of his heart.
But all the precious ointment, sacrificed
To voice his human love, is lost beside
God's love, unspeakable, in Jesus Christ.

* How Shall I Say It?

How shall I say I love him — this proud man
   Who compasses my moments and my days?
If I could sing as only poets can.
    Then might I strike some lofty note of praise

To voice the wonder, Yet, within my heart
    Sometimes I hear a whisper, sweet and small,
"He chose you on that day that saw love start,
    Because you were a woman first of all".

So I will say it in a woman's way:
    Bright jonquils on the table, lemon pie,
His slippers by the fire. These shall say
    "I love you, love you, love you." I could die

With joy to show him, but instead I live
To be his woman — and to give and give.

Hospital Memories

I have remembered nights of winter rain.
    Gray dawns of mist-smoke rising from a hill,
And through these latter days of weary pain
   These that I loved have fortified my will;

Beauty of hawthorn, dewy-sweet at morn,
    Touch of the sea-wind, stinging sharp and kind,
Glint of the sunrise on a field of corn —
    Because of these I still may keep my mind.

I can look out on days that follow days
    Gray-garbed and lonely down that corridor,
And face the new with neither blame nor praise,
    Because within the vast, unmeasured store

Of memory' s wealth my soul can find again
Mist of the dawn and fragrance of the rain. *

Hungry Hawk

In circled flight he mounts up to the sky
    And rests, as one who waits upon a stair;

Then suddenly, and swifter than the eye.
    Comes sliding down the banister of air.

No pleasure cruise is his, no idle whim
    To stretch the wings and lightly float away;

This is dark business, sinister and grim:
    He takes the air that he might take the prey.

My heart is like a hungry hawk in flight,
    My heart is like a lonely searching bird;

It scans the dark and listens through the night,
   Eager to pounce upon your whispered word.

My heart is like a lonely hawk in flight,
   My hearts knows hunger like the searching bird's

It scans the dark and listens through the night,
   Eager to pounce upon remembered words.

Hymn of Peace

Spirit of love and light
Shine through earth's troubled night,
Heal our distress.
Conflict and fears abound,
Gross darkness all around —
Only in Thee is found
Power to bless.

Spirit of God forgive
Our erring ways, and live
In every soul;
That man's extremity,
Most Holy One, may be
God's opportunity
To take control.

Spirit of light and love,
Come like a gentle dove,
On wings of peace.

Enter the heart of man:
Only Thy presence can
Fulfill God's righteous plan —
That wars may cease.

Knitting Song For An Old Woman

Over and under.
   That's how it goes;
What I am thinking
   Nobody knows.
Making a sweater,
   That's all they see:

Over and under
   One, two and three.

Over and under,
   Back through the years,
Voices that I hear
   Nobody hears.
   
"Tends to her knitting",
   That's all they say.
Nobody guesses -
   How could they, pray?

How could they know that
   One, two and three,
Is more than a sweater,
   More than they see?

1-fore than some piece-work,
   Out in the sun,
To an old woman
   Whose work is done.

Out of her memories
   High on a shelf.
Life is the sweater
    She knits for herself.

Love is the needle,
  And dreams are the wool,

With which an old woman
   Makes age beautiful.

    Mixing Bowl

Light are the words that the manory turns
Deep in the bowl of life,
Light as the eggs that my beater whips,
But dear to the heart of a wife.

Sweet is the love that is mixed with than,
Sweet as the sugar crushed
Here in my yellow mixing bowl -
Love that cannot be hushed.

Fine is the faith that will stand the test.
Sunny or stormy weather -
Fine as the flour I sift in now,
Binding it all together.

Gratitude

For poplars, lifted to the sun
And silver-flanked,
For slow buds bursting one by one,
For joy unleashed and dreams begun,

Now God be thanked.

For moonlight, drifting from the place
Of clouds high-banked,
To show a chaste and lovely face;
For morning dew and cobweb lace,

Now God be thanked.

When I am short on gratitude,
And hard to please
With common comforts, daily food,
Lord send -white daybreak through a wood
   
I'm on my knees.

City Park

Let me look long upon this cool and still
   Green epic of the earth, wedged in between
The walls of industry, this quiet scene
   Where comes no traffic rumble, nor the shrill

Newsboy announcing. Let me sit and fill
   My homesick heart with other gold and green:
The sifted gold of sunlight through the lean,
   Dark shapes of pines upon a far-off hill.

Man's most need, though he rush and toil and fret
   For food and raiment, is not met in these.
The naked soul has need of canopies
   Of silence, and the hungers that beset

The lone heart are appeased by nothing less
Than growing beauty, clothed in quietness.

In Times Like These


"Soul, take your ease," in praise of idleness
   One man exclaimed - and drew his knickers on
"In times of economic storm and stress
   One learns a lot of golf twixt dawn and dawn,

Tomorrow may bring back the daily grind -
   This is the hour of opportunities.
Soul, take your ease, the road to pleasure find
   One has the leisure in such times as these."

Another cried: "Soul, find a book and steep
   Yourself in learning - strive against the day
When strong men may be needed; study, keep
   One step ahead." These things I heard two say.

"Not from the east", where finished is the test.
"Cometh promotion, neither from the west."

Last Leaves

It falls....Weep, Heart, but know your tears are vain
The trees' green spring is but a crimson stain:
Long since, the lark his parting song has sung,
The last rose faded; but while yet there clung

One leaf unto the branch the heart could sing -
But now it falls. Weep, Heart, weep for the Spring .
Weep for the promise made.
Weep for the vows unpaid.

Weep for the hopes diminished,
Weep - and when you have finished,
Lean close your tear-stained face to earth and hear,
Sweeter than music falling on the ear,

Her answer: "Not a Spring, forgotten, lies
In fallen leaves; for when the last leaf dies,
God's hands most wisely crush it, bit by bit,
Back into dust - and make new Springs of it."

It falls - Weep, Heart, but not a tear avails
To call the lone dream back - the last dream fails:
Laughter and love have left life's laden bough
Long since. With only dreams for comfort, now

The last dream falls - and withers in the grass.
Weep Heart, that beauty fails, that dreams must pass,
Weep for the stricken ways,
Weep for the empty days,

Weep for the doubts that hover,
Weep and, when weeping over.
Lean close and hear your own heart give you back
Wisdom enough to fill lifes' little lack:

"No dream is lost: the hope that bade you lift
Your face to dreams is God's unfailing gift.
In other lives and loves the dream endures -
Not less itself because no longer yours."

Home Thoughts At Sea

All day, across the blue brow of the sea,
  Trail lives of creamy foam,
Lifted in sudden light, have been to me
  A hawthorn hedge at home -

In such a way, on Spring nights, moves the urge
   To beauty in between
Hedgerows - and breaks, at last, a whitening surge
   Of blossoms on the green -

In such a way, and yet more intimate.
  More dear, the still foam lies,
That is white fragrance by the garden gate.
  And glory in the eyes.

The fabric is not lightly tom apart
  Of which old dreams are knit,
When, still, a hawthorn hedge can stab my heart
  Just to remanber it.

Quarrel

All that can be buried let us bury
    Far out of sight:
You can smile again and I'll be merry.
    This much is right.

"What we couldn't have we never hoped for",
    This be our cry.
You can leave behind the things we groped for,
    And so can I.

Yes:  And, Heart,  before we drop the shovel,
    Turning to run,
Life will merge into a dreary hovel,
    Lost to the sun.

Life will be a house whose every rafter
    Echoes your tread;
You will start, at dusk, to hear my laughter
    Back from the dead.

All that can be buried - yes, but, lover,
    Here is the foil:
We have erred again:  You  cannot cover
    Love up with soil.

River Songs

I -   Windy Willow

   Windy willow, in the sun
   Lifted high,
   You are ripples on a pool
   Made of sky:

   You have silver water speech
   In your slinder arms, that reach
   Hither, yonder. They beseech
   Like a cry.

   Windy willow, by the light
   Of the moon,
   You are echoes of an old
   River tune:

   You have choruses of frogs,
   Water slopping fallen logs,
   And the long cool drip of fogs,
   In your croon.

   Windy willow, river-taught
   You would be
   If I met you in a park,
   Suddenly:

   More the lifting and the lull
   Of bright waters deep and full,
   More the slow still river-pull.
   Than a tree.

II -  Redwinged Blackbirds

   Breathless on the rivers brink
   One can only stand and drink
   
   Deeply, thirstily, of them:
   Blackbirds on a rushe's stem.
   
   Glossy black and shining green,
   With the scarlet touch between:
   
   Here is color that defies
   All attempt to analyze.
   
   Blackbirds on a rushe's stem!
   I have touched the garments hem
   
   Of fulfillment. I can clutch
   All of beauty in this much.


III - River Twilight

   Day is a covey of sunbeams
   Caught in the older trees;

   Night is a hardened hunter
   Crouching upon his knees.

   Ever the silence deepens,
   Ever the shadows fall;

   The evening star is a bird-dog
   Waiting the hunting call.

   Wounded wing, in the water
   Beat it to flecks of foam:

   Light goes out on the river -
   Run, little birds, run home.


IV -  Blue Interval

   This has been an azure moment
   Uttered shyly, in three words:

   Bright blue sky and deep blue water,
   And the blue, blue wings of birds

   Wings of berons lifting lightly,
   Slowly at the rivers edge,

   In a curve of beauty binding
   Sky and water like a pledge.

   Life will give me back this moment,
   By all waters:   I shall start,

   Suddenly, to feel the beating
   Of blue wings against my heart.

Supper Song

Oh never I set out the evening meal
   Or scatter the food about,
But I think, how life is a table cloth
   And love is the feast spread out.

How one is seated at either end,
   And love is the meal between,
Where two may nibble a -whole life long
   And share in the fat and the lean.

And whether they dine on the food of faith
   Or drink of the cup of care,
I think how two, to the journey's end,
   Rejoice in this simple fare.

For though they may hunger, little or much
   They know that the meal suffices,
Where love is the daily butter and bread
   And love is the sugar and spices.

So never I set out the evening meal,
   But softly to One above
I whisper thanks for the table cloth
   Of life - and the feast of love.

Sweeping Song

In t±ie loaded dustpan,
   Just before I spill it,
Let me see, besides trash,
   What there is to fill it.

I have swept up courage
   With this slender token
Taken from the window -
   Fragile moth wings broken.

I have swept up wisdom
   Fallen from the fetters
Of a book, in this page
   With its yellow letters.

I have swept down patience,
   In the silver leaving
Of an old gray spider
   Busy with her weaving.

I have swept ambition
   Out in little pieces -
Where a child's hands folded:
   Paper in white creases.

Sing a song of cleaning:
   Sweeping is a pleasure
Little, dirty dustpan
    You are full of treasure!

Tea Time

Time to set the tea things:
   Round and round we go;
Will I ever be things
   In life's little show?

Will I ever be things
   In a gown of silk?
Time to set the tea things:
   Butter, sugar, milk.

Time to set the tea things
   Not a sonnet done !
Daddy and the wee things,
   Though, are lots of fun.

Daddy and the wee things,
   What a group to miss!
I have set the tea things,
   Often, thinking this.

I have set the tea things
   With a heart so full
I have come to see things
   Plain, are beautiful.

The Slew Stars Came

The slew stars came this evening, and their shining
   Is not a radiance, but still white words
Heard somewhile and remembered, starting, humming,
   A love song in the heart, Like honing birds,

Wings tilted to the sunset, dipping, drifting,
   The slow stars come and lean above the hills;
Their ccming is white fingers reaching, lifting
   The drab days disappointments and it's ills.

The slow stars came this evening. All that battered
   The quick self pity and the stem regret,
Sean suddenly more vague than shadows - smothered
   By the swift joy that there is beauty yet.

That there is beauty, high above regretting,
Now God be thanked for stars - and for forgetting.

Two Married: The Heights

Do you remember how we came that day,
   Breathless with love, unto a hill and stood,
My lips athirst to drink the wine of play,
   Before I must fulfill my womanhood?

Your hand on mine was sudden secret fire,
   It promised wonder, fear and ecstasy;
Our dreams were high and white as stars, yea higher —
   They were the hope of things we shall not see.

Do you recall how, even going down,
   Our spirits seemed to soar? The dusk that came
And hung a cold gray silence on the town,
   For us was leaping glory and a flame.

You drew me close, your hands caressed my head;
And " All our days shall be as this, " you said.

         332

Two Married: Descent

Sometimes that promised glory haunts my sleep,
   Who all day long in dull monotony
Traverse with you the common days and keep
   The steady pace your footsteps set for me.

Above the deadly level of our lives,
   Somewhere, I know, are other heights to climb;
But all the little tasks of husbands, wives,
   Forbid the quest — we no more have the time.

I fear, I fear sometimes when nights are still,
   That something in my heart will rise and break.
I dare not look too long upon a hill,
   Or think on beauty, sleeping or awake —

Lest you should find me some tempestuous June,
Crying my mad white hunger to the moon.

         329

Two Married: Flight

All night between my dreams the thought of you
   Was daybreak falling from a green-gold tree,
Was beauty mirrored in a drop of dew.
   It woke an old, old urge; it troubled me.

Somewhile before the dawn I left your bed,
   Nor bound the soft confusion of my hair,
More still than silence from your side I fled —
   You, dreaming of a desk, an easy chair.

The world was waking wonder where I ran,
   Gray pools of shadow leapt beneath my feet;
And at the dawn's edge, where the woods began,
   I found you waiting, eager and most sweet —

Your laughter sunlight, and the wind your kiss.
Long in the woods I drank remembered bliss.

         329

Certainties

My heart is young — the breath of blowing trees
   Is more than all the wisdom I have known.
How shall I hedge myself with certainties:
   A dinner gong, the mail, a telephone?

How shall I move among these common things
   And decently observe my household rites,
When love is calling, calling for its wings,
   When all my heart is thirsting for the heights?

When we are dust, these daily tasks will move
   As well without us. Dear, how soon, how soon
We have forgotten what it is to love!
   The moon, that was high hope, is just the moon,

The stars are stars; no wonder stirs a tree.
And life itself is one more certainty.

         329

My Gifts 

Long years I wrought upon my little gifts;
   Then came and knocked at your half-open door—
Timit and tremulous.  You smiled at me 
   And bade me enter—I could ask no more 
   
Kneeling beside you I unwrapped my gifts—
   Unfolding each that you might look and see:
Sweet Innocence, and Faith, and Hope, and Trust,
   And Loyalty to Truth, and Modesty.
   
And over all and compassing the rest,
   A Love as high and holy as the stars:
Builded of Youth's divinest dreams,
   The Great One Dream—all these were yours.
   
You took each gift up in your smooth white hands,
   And fingered it a moment—as a child 
Might play with some new toy—then growing tired,
   You tossed each in the corner there—and smiled.
   
Oh! you were kind—you called me goodly names,
   You looked into my eyes and bade me stay;
But I, who builded -all- upon my dreams,
   Must take my little gifts and go away.
   
I shall not seek another altar shrine 
   On which to lay the gifts I made for you: 
I could not give them now to some one else—
   My childish dreams that never will come true.
   
But there's a quiet place out in the woods,
   Where all night long the sad winds come and play;
There I shall go and dig a little grave 
   Beneath the trees—and lay my gifts away.

The kindly leaves will whisper over me ,
   The lonely stars will watch me from above ;
And I shall come away again, content 
   To pity you—O you, who cannot love.

Dawn——and Dawn

Dawn——and a flush of crimson
Heralds the coming sun;
Somewhere a lark is chanting
His morning requiem.
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Dawn——and a mist of silver
Wraps every blade and leaf;
My lone heart keeps repeating
The burden of its grief.
