<article id='poem_3'>	<h2>Above The Clouds</h2>
	<p class='poem'>Like Great gray birds of doom above our plane,
The dark clouds threatened, broke in deluge, poured
Against the windows blinding sheets of rain.
The sky was ominous; but still we soared.

And then a sudden miracle of light:
The sun in all its glory, golden, warm;
And, far below, a sea of soft clouds, white
As driven snow. We flew above the storm.

On God's side, all our clouds must look like these.
What seems to us so sinister and grim &mdash;
The tears, the tests, the trials and tragedies &mdash;
Unfold as something beautiful to Him.

He knows -what wonder waits beyond earth's strife.
Ride high with Him above the storms of life.</p>

<article id='poem_4'>	<h2>A Bride's Song</h2>
	<p class='poem'>Your name is proud as lilies white and still,
    Your name is deep as water without sound,
As radiant as sunlight on a hill,
    As secret as the first buds out of ground;

Your name is quietness when trumpets flare,
    Your name is singing when the silence palls.
As cool as curtains blowing in air,
    As soft as elm trees when the first snow falls.

Beloved, you have given me this thing
    That clothes me round with wind and star and dew,
With swift exulting and shy wondering,
    That makes me not myself but part of you&mdash;

A strange new creature born of song and flame:
Beloved, you have given me your name!</p>

<article id='poem_7'>	<h2>A Deserted House</h2>
	<p class='poem'>Where is the joy, the laughter and the mirth
   That once these walls, now crumbling ruins, held?
Fled, long since fled down scattered ways of earth;
   One with the dust by vagrant winds dispelled.

Where are the feet that trod so lightly here,
   The careless spoken words, the dreams unsaid?
Naught, naught remains of that forgotten cheer;
   Silenced, the halls re-echo to no tread.

	<p class='poem'>Heart of the Dawn, I heard you after sun
   Move through the trees while day was yet unsaid.
Soft stirred the leaves &mdash; your brief throbs one by one
   Fell on the ear like griefs uncomforted.

Pathos was there so rare and exquisite
   I marveled. Did lost memories start awake,
Pull at your strings and move across the night,
   That sudden you should rise, and sob, and break?

Heart of the Dawn, I knew you for a bird,
   Gray wing, rose breast &mdash; dawn's blended harmonies.
And yet I knew you not. I only heard,
   Out of the shy confusion of the trees,

One white word lift and tremble &mdash; spelling love.
Was it yourself O Heart, or God, or Dove?</p>

	<p class='poem'>Youth is for love, the poets long have sung
   In threadbare words of moon-mist and of dawn:
The great One Flame, lit bravely by the young,
   Flickers with age, burns dimly &mdash; and is gone.

They do not know, Beloved, these who make
   A love that runs to music, leaps with light,
Quivers at stars, how struggle and heartbreak
   Have lit a flame that burns on through the night.

Love is for age. When hearts no longer tread
   The dangerous ascent, the deep abyss,
When all that needs audition has been said
   And wonder wakes no longer in a kiss.

Still burns the flame. And two, in time of storm,
Draw up to love &mdash; and find it safe and warm.</p>

I knew that she was walking with clean skies

I knew that russet leaves, in drifted heaps,
   Crowded the comers of her mind; that part
Of some lost hope the life defeated keeps
   Was pushing up the windows of her heart.

I knew she was remembering the way
   The country ages, mellowing to rust,
That she had found a dream from yesterday

	<p class='poem'>Beloved it is night. Lift not thy face &mdash;
   Pass through the garden with a muted voice;
This is the hour of dreaming. This the place
   Where out of time the One Dream of our choice

May suddenly be born. But speak no word &mdash;
   Let fall one whisper even, and the rose
That sleeps by yonder casement, would be stirred
   To dream of things not any flower knows.

Lift not thy face. Beloved. It is night &mdash;&mdash;-
   Dusk and a silence in the garden blend.
But in thy face is wonder born of light,
   And in my heart a song that knows no end.

A light, a song....Beloved, turn away
Lest all the garden wake and call it day!</p>

	<p class='poem'>When sleepy birds wake up to greet the dawn
   With songs of praise, and like a silver scroll
The morning sky unfolds to wait upon
   The coming of the sun, then lifts my soul

Its canticle of love, O Christ, to Thee &mdash;
   Creator of the whole. My glad heart pours
Its gratitude in floods of ecstacy
   And, like a bird, my spirit sings and soars.

But comes the dusk, the time for sheltering,
   When drooping pinions fold on drowsy birds,
My heart seeks out its shelter too. I sing
   No more:  Thou art  too near for need of words;

Thy quiet hand is on my heart to bless,
And I am wrapped in Thy great gentleness.</p>

   Beloved, share your pleasure with the wind;
Run in the light and fling your laughter far,
   In leaping wave and dancing sunlight find

Renewal of your mood,&mdash;but come not here.
   You will not need my touch, my spoken words
To add one little measure to your cheer.
   Beloved, give your singing to the birds.

But when your heart too quiet grows with pain,
   Slip through the dusk and come again to me;
Sobbing your grief like soft insistent rain,
   Yielding your broken faith to sympathy;

And in my wonan's peace find grace to bear
The only moment's that our love can share.</p>

	<p class='poem'>Lord, I have swept my house and taken out
   Fine linen, silver, all to honor Thee;
And now at twilight, with these spread about,
   My heart reminds me with strange irony,

With mute misgivings and with vague -unrest:
   I have no gift to give, no feast to spread.
At every table where Thou wert the guest,
   It ever was Thyself who broke the bread.

Lord, I have been a Martha all the day,
   And now as darkness falls I am aware
That quiet Mary chose the better way.

Thy welcome, but have naught to offer Thee &mdash;

	<p class='poem'>The blind man, on the comer every day,
   Stands stretching forth his hand &mdash; but not for alms
He has the Truth of God to give away &mdash;
   A fresh supply of tracts. His troubling palms

Can hardly hold their treasure; and his lips
   Cannot control the current of his song;
He hums the old hymns softly as he slips
    A leaflet here and there among the throng.

He knows that most will pass and scarcely glance.
    But still, in rain or sunshine, he must try
To give the gospel, though men look askance.
    If he were peddling pencils they might buy,

In pity for lost sight; for most are kind.
They do not know he sees &mdash; and they are blind.</p>

Life makes her gifts, and once to me she gave
   To look on Beauty. Deep I drank, -until
With very seeing did my eyes grow blind.
   (There is a joy too great for human sight!)

Mine be the curse. Alone, I am consigned
   Through endless days to walk, in utter night.

And yet, for very blindness do I see
   More faithfully and sure, who light dead eyes
With tapers from the shrine of memory.
   For still, proud seas, gaunt peaks and tawny skies,

Gray clouds, and trees, hold converse down the years,
Remembered and undimned by latter tears.</p>

Cleaves downward to the earth&mdash;and startled night
   Slinks into shadow with a stricken cry

That mounts in blue mist from the sleepy hills,

That lifts and floats above the trees, and fills

Where will the wondering and secret things,

Bereft of the cool covert of her wings,

&ldquo;Those were but words, and that was long ago,"

Whenever I reach out to break the bread,

His pleading voice entreats; and I am led

That broken body breaks my stubborn heart

Fear not, when the spring shall find you
Doubt and grief no more shall bind you:

   Ask any man and he will tell you that.
The constant babble of a brook at play,
   And women dropping in to sew and chat,

Too soon grow tiresome. Every man agrees
   Insessant chatter makes for little brain,
And so condemns the two, nor ever sees
   How brooks and wcmen talk to hide their pain.

Because the hearts of women are too proud
   To stoop to tears, they bid their longings hush,
another their grief, and smile and talk too loud.
    This is the way of women. And brooks rush

The same wild way, because they must forget
Old wounds of stick and stone that stab them yet.</p>

	<p class='poem'>Love is what all have said. But love is more:
   More than the brinming cup of tenderness,
The word, the glance, the touch. These all explore
   The fringe of love; but love is in excess

Of these. To realize its cherished goal.
   Love climbs the lonely mountains of the mind,
Love probes the secret caverns of the soul.
   Yet he, who thinks he sees love whole, is blind.

Love is what all have said. But love will be
   What none can say until, with clearer sight,
Through fadeless ages of eternity,
   We learn to read the simple word aright,

For God is love. The little we have known
Will find its ultimate in Him, alone.</p>

	<p class='poem'>If on some perfect planet we could stand
   And with disinterest view the lives we lead,
See, through our clearer eyes, the life indeed,
   Stripped of its daily dole &mdash; the small demand &mdash;&mdash;-

A clean-cut, naked fact; could we conmand
   The strength that we assume, the pride &mdash; our creed
Whereby in confidence we dare exceed,
   Or say we do, all else Creation planned?

Could we in that brief interval compare
   With tree, with rock, that neither stir nor fret;
With humble soil, that doth no pride beget;
   With all wild things that roam, and birds in air?

We could not. Yet we light our centuries
With, &ldquo;Man shall have dominion over these."</p>

	<p class='poem'>It is not dead, &mdash; the beauty that we knew:
   Long time it slept, Beloved, but today,
Beneath an old log where one violet grew,
   I found our hearts' young treasure laid away;

I found the tender words that had grown cold
   For lack of being said; I found the songs
That lit our every twilight hour of old,
   And all the wonder that to love belongs.

It had not died, Beloved: when God found
   That life would rob us of earth's little best,
He hid our golden secret undergound,
   And let a violet hold it to its breast &mdash;

Well knowing I would pass along that way.
I found all beauty we have known today.</p>

   Bright spans of splendor with the strength of steel;
Seine build skyscrapers, gaunt and gray and high,
   Groping among the stars, as those who feel

For some remembered beauty lost in time.
   These have their little hour of acclaim:
One moment lifted to the heights sublime &mdash;
   The next, forgotten in the hall of fame.

Sane men build broken bodies:   stoop and take
   The scattered puzzle of disrupted life
And, fitting piece to piece together, make
   Order from chaos, harmony from strife.

	<p class='poem'>Do streets remember, when the long dark makes
   A little silence in between two days
Of traffic, hew, somewhere, the sunrise breaks
   Across gold hill-tops and the sudden rays

Finger green branches? Do they then recall
   Intimacies of earth that now they miss,
Rustle of windy branches and the small
   Bird-talk at dawn? Do streets remember this?

Do streets remember, or have they too long
   Been burdened with the weight of life, the press
Of countless footsteps, to call back the song
   Of lark or robin? Does the weariness

From crowded moments crush their dreaming &mdash; or
Do streets remember beauty known before?</p>

	<p class='poem'>The gaunt trees closer pressed each hungry mouth
   Unto the earth's dry breast, and day by day,
Wasted and worn by weary weeks of drought,
   The lean hills lifted faces, ashen-gray,

Up to the unrepentant sky. The streams
   Long unreplenished from on high, had grown
Frailer and feebler than forgotten dreams,
   Dry gulches yielding only stick and stone.

Beyond the cabin door she saw it all,
   As one who sees, not seeing, for her heart
Beat with a strange new ecstacy:  A small
   Pink bundle stirred beneath the covers &mdash; part

Of her and him; and in her flowing breast
There was no drought &mdash; only deep joy, sweet rest.</p>

   Remorse at last in one bright silver flood.
Up from the startled earth the young green crept.
   Hill, tree and stream drank wonder where each stood;

Three weeks and transformation had its way:
   Slim silver pencils scribbled leaf and flower
Upon an empty page, long waste and gray,
   Leaving the drought a half-remembered hour.

Within the cabin door she sat and stared.
   Her eyes, deep-circled, bore the sombre stain
Of agony; her hungry breast was bared
   Night-long unto the keen cool edge of pain.

Even the new mound in the pasture south
Was turning green. But all her days were drought.</p>

Not so much fragrance, nor the long array

But beauty nineteen hundred years away.
   When One came back who briefly left the world.

I will remember how one garden slept,
   And woke to Ressurection and to Life;
And I will plant a garden, who have kept
   A slender faith to dig with. Out of strife

And turmoil, I will turn and break the sod &mdash;

   Without His care. He sends the rain, the sun:
No flower wakes and pokes its bright face out
   Unless He guards and cherishes each one.

And did you know that, when His loved ones chose
   A place for Jesus, after He had died,
They found a garden &mdash; and from there He rose,
   That first glad Easter morning, glorified?

So make your garden, little boy, each spring:
God gives us gardens &mdash; for remembering.</p>

Deeply into the heart of purple flags

There were green country lanes that I went down,

May here intrude, nor any echo find

The shy soft footsteps of the forest wind.

And here is holiness, remote and rare

It touches trees and hovers in the air

	<p class='poem'>&ldquo;Immovable as mountains," men will say &mdash;
   And yet our God says, &ldquo;Faith the size of one
Snail mustard seed: will be enough to sway
   A mountain, if we say to it, &ldquo;Begone."

No one but God could issue such commands:
   He, only, holds the key to certainty;
And yet, he places it within our hands
   With just these simple words, &ldquo;Believe in Me."

Blot out the stars, erase the oceans, thrust
   The universe aside &mdash; one thing endures:
The Word of God. In that the heart can trust.
   Have faith in God. His blessed Book assures

The faithful that to ask is to receive;
Not one is turned away who will believe.</p>

	<p class='poem'>He passes. Let the voice of song be hushed
   A little time. Within the saddened heart
Let only dreams of music that he brushed
   From strings, now silent, wake again and start;

Bring to this place no verbal offering
   Of melody. The master plays no more:
Lay down the bow, Life is a broken string &mdash;
   And silence fitting tribute at Death's door.

He passes. For a time be still.......And then
   From hands that learned of him to wield the bow,
Let there be song, and in the lives of men
   Let there be strength that his life taught to grow;

Let us go forward from the place of tears
To carry beauty down the troubled years.

	<p class='poem'>Within his heart there is a lonely place
   Where even love dare not intrude: like some
Pale star that floats upon the rim of space,
   Remote and unapproachable. There come

To this still place no tender word, no touch,
   No shared rememberings, no dream discussed.
Though two may love and long, however much,
   One enters here alone &mdash; because he must.

Beside the deep and limpid pool of thought
   One stoops, alone, and kneels; and takes away
The word, the song, the truth that must be taught
   The burning beauty for the common day.

None other goes with him, nor great, nor small.
But what he brings away he brings for all.</p>

   Cool was the earth unto a child's hot face:
With small hands clenched I sobbed, &ldquo;Oh little house
   Shut in by leaves, you are my hiding place."

There often, fresh from punishment, I came
   And flung myself, face down, upon the fern,
Buried the eyes to hide my weepings' shame,
   Learning the first hard truths a child must learn.

Oh Heart, where can we run for hiding now
   From prying eyes, where sob the lone grief out?
No little leaf leans low, no laurel bough
   Stoops down to screen. These city walls are stout,

But oh, they cannot shut man's secret ills
Away from pitys gaze - that takes the hills.</p>

Of sunlit waters woos them, no wild geese

Hills have been set too long 'twixt earth and sky

Have yielded satisfaction: for the tie
   That binds contentment in remembering.

Hills have no envy. Though the brunt of storms
   Age-long they bear, this high thought lifts them up,
Runs like a fire through all their being, warms

Of barren years:   since first the dawn of Time
Hills have been man's encouragement to climb.</p>

Call to wake thee from thy peaceful slumber;

   At Calvary God made a place.

   At Calvary, where Jesus died,
   God's gate of love stands open wide;
   Now all, who trust, from sin are free &mdash;
   God dries all tears at Calvary.

2. When shadows fall God waits to bless,
   When storms arise He says, &ldquo;Be still!"
   Weep not for all life's emptiness:
   The cluttered heart He cannot fill.

3. When clouds engulf and skies are gray,
   God holds the sunshine in His hands:

   There is a Light from Calvary.

2. When earthly loves have ceased to be,

3. Though lost in sin, though clothed with shame,
   It was for you the Savior came:
   However far your feet may roam,

4. Can you ignore, can you neglect,

<article id='poem_267'>	<h2>River Songs</h2>
	<p class='poem'>I -   Windy Willow

   Windy willow, in the sun
   Lifted high,
   You are ripples on a pool
   Made of sky:

   You have silver water speech
   In your slinder arms, that reach
   Hither, yonder. They beseech
   Like a cry.

   Windy willow, by the light
   Of the moon,
   You are echoes of an old
   River tune:

   You have choruses of frogs,
   Water slopping fallen logs,
   And the long cool drip of fogs,
   In your croon.

   Windy willow, river-taught
   You would be
   If I met you in a park,
   Suddenly:

   More the lifting and the lull
   Of bright waters deep and full,
   More the slow still river-pull.
   Than a tree.

II -  Redwinged Blackbirds

   Breathless on the rivers brink
   One can only stand and drink
   Deeply, thirstily, of them:
   Blackbirds on a rushe's stem.
   
   Glossy black and shining green,
   With the scarlet touch between:
   Here is color that defies
   All attempt to analyze.
   
   Blackbirds on a rushe's stem!
   I have touched the garments hem
   Of fulfillment. I can clutch
   All of beauty in this much.


III - River Twilight

   Day is a covey of sunbeams
   Caught in the older trees;
   Night is a hardened hunter
   Crouching upon his knees.

   Ever the silence deepens,
   Ever the shadows fall;
   The evening star is a bird-dog
   Waiting the hunting call.

   Wounded wing, in the water
   Beat it to flecks of foam:
   Light goes out on the river -
   Run, little birds, run home.


IV -  Blue Interval

   This has been an azure moment
   Uttered shyly, in three words:
   Bright blue sky and deep blue water,
   And the blue, blue wings of birds

   Wings of berons lifting lightly,
   Slowly at the rivers edge,
   In a curve of beauty binding
   Sky and water like a pledge.

   Life will give me back this moment,
   By all waters:   I shall start,
   Suddenly, to feel the beating
   Of blue wings against my heart.</p>

<article id='poem_61'>	<h2>Ballad For Any Summer</h2>
	<p class='poem'>He was a sailor's son,
Bore with the tug of water
Pulling hard at his sleeve
She was a hill-man's daughter.

She was a woodland fern,
Plucked from the quiet places .
He was a lifted sail,
Stretched for the windy spaces.

He found her shyness sweet,
Smiled at her naive greeting;
Something big in his heart
Hastened her own heart's beating.

Under the August moon
Faith that he thought enduring
Broke with the sea and sail,
Finding her more alluring.

Once, when the silence spread
Close as a cloak around than,
Love was a tide that swept
In from the sea and drowned them.

There in the moonlight, he
Promised never to fail her:
He was a lover now,
More than he was a sailor.

Ah, but he had no wit,
Not on the sea to reckon:
Scarce had the summer waned
When it began to beckon.

He was a sailor's son:
All that a sea-man misses,
Inland, pulled at his heart,
Smothering her young kisses.

Often her blue eyes brim:
Grieving to have bereft her,
Often he wakes at dawn.
Nevertheless, he left her.

Weep for the sea's bright call,
Weep for her hearts undoing:
She was a hill-man's child,
Born for a hill-man's wooing.

She was a mountain maid,
Born to be wife and mother,
But for a sea-man's love,
Now she will wed another.

Now, as she tucks in seeds,
Out in her garden kneeling,
Eyes that are bright with dreams
Follow a lone gull's wheeling.

Follow a far sky trail.
Blue as the sea, for token.....
Never a sail turns home,
Home to a heart thats broken.

Weep for a sumner's schemes.
Weep for the hearts that find them,
Follow, and then go back -
Leaving a dream behind than.</p>

Proud in the armor of morning.

And the long, long stride of their coming,
Terrible, swift, relentless.
The day is a giant
Riding upon the edge of the world.

The night is a little black slave,
I have seen him, stricken with terror,
Running before the day,
Helpless, bewildered:

Soft is the sound of his going,
Footsteps that sink in the star-dust,
Timid, uncertain.
The night is a little black slave

Fleeing before the giant.
And yet &mdash;
If morning found me alone
Upon a high hill-top

Where I could hear the Day
Galloping, galloping,
I should not turn to the giant
Eyes that were frightened and pleading,

Straight in the path of his coming
I should stand as a grim wall stands &mdash;
And laugh in his face.
But if, in the hush of the twilight,

A little black slave should whisper
Softly, persistent,
Brushing my cheek with dreams
Kinder than hands are,

If I heard through the stretches of silence
The patter of footsteps that vanish,
And felt the breath of the night
Trembling upon me.

To fluff his feathers and dismiss
The dust of earth, beneath this spray.
He dips and ducks and struts away,

To give his wings a furtive flip
And cock his head to watch than drip.

Perhaps if we were just as wise

Fluffed up his feathers in the rain

Transfixed with desire;
Something tickled his ear with two words &mdash;
&ldquo;Farther, higher".

He could not tell what he wanted to find,
But he kept looking here,
Looking there, until small reaching hands
Closed on fear:

Until coldness crept down through his spine,
And his feet would not stir...........
Now he knew what he longed to embrace &mdash;
&ldquo;Moth-er-ER!"</p>

	<p class='poem'>God grew so tired of sitting
   Way up in Heaven alone,
He said, &ldquo;I'll make a new thing,
   Some thing my very own.

The earth that I have fashioned
   By men has been defiled."
And so, to please His fancy,
   God made a little child.

He took a burst of sunshine
   And wrought a golden smile,
Then wrapped it in a little heart
   Simple and free from guile.

Twin stars He stole from Heaven
   To make the shining eyes,
And rosy cheeks were fashioned
   Out where the sunset lies.

A brook came dancing, sparkling,
   He caught its silver note,
And lo! a rippling laugh was heard
   Spilled from a tiny throat.

And then, because all laughter
   Is sweeter mixed with pain,
He made some tear-drops for his child
   From little drops of rain.

It was a lot of labor;
   But when the little child
Played round the door of Heaven
   God often watched, and smiled.

And Heaven was a different place,
   Till, looking down one day,
He saw a lonely wanan &mdash;
   And gave His child away.</p>

Do you remember when our love,

Was still so small the whole delight
   Was just to keep it near one?

When every day was holiday,
   In any kind of weather,
Because we nursed our little love
   And tended it together?

The years have seen that love grow up
   To such supreme dimensions
It hardly ever asks for now
   The fond heart's small attentions.

It seldom seeks the boon of arms,
   The hand-clasps and caresses,
This sturdy love we lean upon
   Through failures and successes.

We are so fortunate to have
   This fire to warm December,
This safe and certain flame of love &mdash;

Sometimes (I know it's foolish, dear)
   It seems this tall new stranger
Might grow beyond us. Do you think

Along the war-scarred landscape beats;
Trees rock, and heavy banks of snow
Plunge headlong into pools below;
And mournfully, from dark to light,
The winds go howling through the night.

In Argonne Forest Dead Men walk &mdash;
All silently:   They do not talk
Of other days when, side by side,
They fought the noble fight &mdash; and died,
But with unseeing eyes they stare
Into the empty night. They beau
No arms to wield against the foe,
But still in solemn ranks they go,
These tattered heroes, &mdash; on and on
Through gloomy swamps of old Argonne.

In Argonne Forest, when the spring
Shall smile again, and birds shall sing,
And deep within that Forest's gloom
Light winds shall waft a faint perfume
From hidden flowers, when over all
The dreary landscape light shall fall
And sunshine penetrated the deep
Dark glooms where Dead lien cannot sleep,
The eye shall look in vain for than:
Those tattered hungry forms of men
Will lurk no more, &mdash; They will be gone
When Spring shall come to old Argonne.

Only, beside the river there,
The trees shall wear a loftier air.
As though those Souls of wandering men
Had somehow entered into them:
For each shall whisper unto each
The Loving Truths that Dead Men teach.
And when the solitary night
Shall brood o'er Argonne, lo! the light
From many million stars shall keep
A silent watch &mdash; where Dead Men sleep.</p>

	<p class='poem'>I  &mdash; Visitor From Yesterday

Whoever reads may find himself a host
   To more than words:  a quaint, invisable,
Disturbing presence, moving like a ghost
   From yesterday. A strangely lovable,

Engaging ghost, who cannot quite forget:
   &ldquo;Poor Richard" leans from out the past to peer
At how the line is spaced, the type is set.
   He almost seems to say, &ldquo;What have we here?"

II  &mdash; He Dreamed A Stove

Perhaps from out the gleaming coals it came,
   When backs were freezing and each face grew hot,
The swift idea: why not capture flame
   And lock it in a box? Why not, why not?

It might have been like this. Nobody knows
   Just where the thought is born that makes the deed.
Nor really cares, just so it grows and grows
   And reaches out to fill a heart-felt need.

He dreamed a stove. But oh, he dreamed much more:
   The smell of home-made bread and popping com,
The old men gathered at the country store;
   And children, huddled on some icy mom,

With hands outstretched. All cherished, all esteaned.
All simple, warm and friendly things &mdash; he dreamed.

III  - Man With A Kite

Was he a boy upon a windy hill,
   His kite-string in his hand, when first he knew
The wild applause of thunder and the thrill
   Of lightning flashing on the startled view?

Was he a boy, when first he felt the pull
   Of something stronger, stronger than the wind:
A young idea, bright and beautiful,
   That could be more, if harnessed, disciplined?

And did he run along the hills with it
   And toss it, with his kite, into the sky;
Then draw it to himself and try to fit
   The thought into the scheme he meant to try?

How many years, how many kites took flight,
Before he knew he held the key to light!

IV &mdash; Fire! Fire!

No matter where he went, or what he saw,
   He had a spark that kindled into flame.
The fire of learning and the fire of law
   Were both, alike, ignited in his name.

This is a truth philosophers confess,
   These are the things that statesmen talk about.
But any dozing school-boy cares much less
   For fires so started, than for those put out.

He planned protection. He could not foresee
   The racing engines, screaming sirens, all
The frenzied furor that would one day be
   Earth's high adventure for each eager, small,

Uplifted face &mdash; unmindful of school books &mdash;
Lost in a world of ladders, hose and hooks.

V  &mdash; Home town (Philadelphia, U.S.A.)

The youth who walked the shabby streets of home,
   Contesting for their shabbiness, could tell
What toil and tears it takes before men come
   With confidence to hang the freedom bell:

The long, long look along the years, that must
   Precede the written word, the law laid down.
For he, who holds the future in his trust,
   Must walk beyond the streets of any town.

Most men find daily living dull and slow:
   These only reach the ultimate by strife.
But some men garner greatness as they go
   About the ordinary tasks of life,

Seeing in simple things what few can see &mdash;
And these live larger than locality.

VI - Here Was America

Here was no man &mdash; but all men put in one:
   Creative though, inventive skill, and zeal
For perseverance at a task begun.
   Here was the high white hope that all men feel,

But few attain to. Here was reaching up.
   And getting under, probing deep; the far,
Raaote, ideal extended. Here the cup
   Of living held one bright, imprisoned star.

Here was America:   the  scathing more
   Than land, or language, something yet to be,
Not found in field or forest, hill or shore:
   The great enduring passion to be free.

Not just in documents upon a shelf,
But freedom written in the man himself.</p>

	<p class='poem'>God did not need to clothe the world with beauty,
He could have left it practical and plain:
He might have made all paths mere dust and duty,
Without the ministry of sun and rain.

But not our God, our gracious God.'
The verdant hills, the quickened clod,
Within a world of storm and strife,
Proclaim He is the Lord of Life.

God did not need to deck the night with splendor,
He could have left the world to carry on
Without the stars, the moonlight warm and tender
He might have left earth desolate till dawn.

But not our God! He had to sow
The sky with stars, that we might know,
Through every dark and troubled night,
Our Father is the Lord of Light.

God did not need to leave His home in glory
To take the sinner's place at Calvary,
That every man might share salvation's story
He could have left us lost eternally.

But not our God! He had to die
At Calvary, that you and I
Might share with Him that home above -
Because He is the Lord of Love.</p>

	<p class='poem'>These are not facts that fence us in below
   The doubts, the fears, the worry and the strife,
All of the vain earth problems that we know
   Here in the grim monotony of life.

We are not creatures of mere circumstance,
   Blown by the swift uncertain wind of time;
We nibble not the crumbled bread of chance &mdash;
   Ours is a heritage that is sublime.

There is a fact eternal in the skies:
   God's Son has triumphed o'er this house of clay
From out our earthly bondage we shall rise
   To glimpse the glory of His face some day.

This is the circumstance that knows no change:
   Christ died for the ungodly long ago;
This is the wonder, beautiful and strange:
   His fellowship the poorest soul may know.</p>

Everywhere and all the time

Every fragrant zephyr blown
   Over a new-mown hay
Calls me back to Bethlehem
   Where the wee Christ lay.

Not a silver ripple breaks
   On a river's brim
But is Jordan lifting spray
   As John buried Him.

When the twilight takes young hills,
   Every silent tree
Is a finger pointing us
   Back to Calvary.

And I never hear the dove's

But I turn to Pentecost

Simple and undefiled &mdash;
Waiting the long, long watch with Joseph,
Eager to hold God's child;

Voices the shepherds heard,
I should have leaned my ear to hearken
Only the Word, the Word.

The star and the bam are an ancient story.
Clothed in the mists of time;
And Mary has gone the way of women,
After her task sublime;

Happily I dismiss:

Another thing. Each understands

They find resourceful ways to share

And carry all, who would not dare
   To carry one alone.

Upon another's need they wait,

I see them standing so because,

<article id='poem_161'>	<h2>Dream House</h2>
	<p class='poem'>The little house was lank and lean,
   With weather-beaten seams,
And often from its slim confines
   I planned the house of dreams.

Set high upon the hills of hope,
   Above the winds of chance,
The house of dreams should be a place
   Of beauty and romance.

And now its turrets cut the sky,
   Its lawns stretch far and wide,
The house of dreams is mine &mdash; but oh,
   There's not a dream inside.

With wistful eyes the years I scan &mdash;
   And in my heart I know
My dreams are in the little house
   I lived in long ago.</p>

	<p class='poem'>Out of the past the old dreams came, and stood
Thronging the dark; and every dream was good&mdash;&mdash;-

Secret and lovely. Clothed in borrowed Light,
They moved in beauty on the fringe of night.

Each was a dream of glory that had been.
I reached forth eager hands to take them in,

But all escaped &mdash; no least one could I keep:
For dreams, though lovely, are for men asleep.

Out of the future, then, a vision came:
It touched my sleeping soul, and broke in flame

Along the dark. As far as eye could see,
I glimpsed the wonder that is yet to be.

The dreams were fair, but oh, the vision rose,
Single and high &mdash; more glorious than those,

More real, more near. I clasped it, with the cry,
&ldquo;Without a vision, Lord, thy people die!"</p>

	<p class='poem'>Two women dwell within my heart,
   Together&mdash;and alone;
And one is mistress of herself,
   And one of field and stone.

My first self rises with the clock
   And preens before the glass;
My second, long before the sun.
   Makes footprints in the grass.

The hand of her who molds my charm
   Works well and tirelessly;
My dearer self wastes golden hours
   In making mirth for me.

But spite of all my first can do
   The lines of age make way.
While she who courts the sun and rain
   Is still as young as they.

Two women dwell within my heart,
   And one belongs to Time,
And one belongs to wind and star
   And broken threads of rhyme.

And when they come to burn her,
   My first &mdash;- whose life is through &mdash;-
A laugh will blow from some far hill,
   &ldquo;My dear, that wasn't you!"</p>

	<p class='poem'>Oh Dust, when I survey thy poor abode,
Behold thee outcast by some wayside road,
Blown on by winds and scattered down the years,
Something in thee my highest self reveres:

I think what part in the infinite plan
Is thine to hold. Thou art to every man
The Alpha and Omega, last and first:
From thee he first drew form, and when the worst

That death is guilty of has come to be,
Through thee he passes to Eternity.
Oh Dust, eternal Dust, that hath withstood
The blight of Time, how oft in careless mood

The hand of man hath lightly dealt with thee
As same lay creature; how relentlessly
Hath fingers, busy with some desk or shelf.
Laid waste the precious atoms of thyself;

Or feet, disdainful of a hidden worth,
Brushed thee aside as simple clods of earth!
Thus &ldquo;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
Who knows what sacred ashes of the dead

In thee have sought repose; what buried kings,
What fallen statesmen speak; what poet sings;
Or what forgotten heroes, laid to rest,
Feel life resurgent in the quiet breast,

When in the hall of Time some vagrant breeze
Disturbs the sleeping dust of centuries

And scatters it abroad? Along the way
We travel so indifferently, the clay

Of Shakespeare or of Milton may be blown
To intimately mingle with our own.

Perhaps some portion of proud Bonaparte
Lives on in thee, oh Dust; or that great heart

That slept in Lincoln's breast, finds life again
In just such contact with the common men

As thou art fellow to. Oh what a tomb
For buried greatness thou hast been! with rocm

To spare for crumbling leaves and withered flowers,
Trees that have harbored oft the sun and showers

Of passing springs: and bits of splintered stone &mdash;
All broken things in Nature hast thou known:

And all earth-creatures, pale and hollow-eyed,
Who pass in dust and know not they have died.

And we, who all too-thoughtless tread above,
Know not what sins we may be guilty of,

What blasphemy is ours, when we deface
This hallowed Dust &mdash; their final resting place.</p>

   With long incessant drouth,
Ifoves in a dizzy dance, and from
   Her gaping, thirsty mouth

She belches words, as hot as flame:
   She flings them to the air.
Dry laughter crackles in her throat
   And leaves but ashes there.

Her reeling form, her scorching words,
   Make madness in the sky;
She twists, and turns, and stabs, and stings,
   And scratches out the eye.

Where are the friendly fields of grass &mdash;
   The same earth we have known?
Lie down, lie down, you thirsty witch,
   And leave the sky alone!

She does not hear. She will not stop,
   Though all the lanes of sky
Be clowded with her dusty screams.
   Though every brave thing die.

She cannot cease:  she has gone mad
   With hunger and with heat,
She does not know the place of earth
   Is underneath the feet.</p>

But the gold and silver glory
   Of the moon-beams all around
Turned to monsters grim and hoary

And the cold and silent spaces,
   Stretching far on either side,
Mocked me with an hundred faces

I went back and faced my Duty

As a child from the depths of his pockets,
You gathered a handful of words,

Each word was a little, bright pin
That you drove in a moment of mischeif

Vanished into the air,
Leaving it flat and ugly.

	<p class='poem'>(Dedicated to our Pastor and read by the author at the meeting
of Presbytery held in Pasadena, Tuesday, March 10, 1942, at
which time the request of the Rev. L. David Cowie for dissolution
of the pastorate between himself and the Vermont Avenue Pres-
byterian Church was concurred).

He asked us to dissolve the pastorate:
   Now didn't he know better than to ask
A thing like that of simple folk? 'Twould rate
   More than a miracle for such a task.

You can't dissolve the ties of love that bind
   A pastor to his people. We will let
Him go&mdash;&mdash;-because he asks it&mdash;&mdash;-but he'll find.
   Day after day that he is with us yet.

He touched our lives and made them beautiful
   With Christ. His every sermon came to be
A pebble dropped into a silent pool,
   Whose ripples spread to fringe eternity.

These are the facts, and what is there to say?
   What is expected of us anyhow?
With words you can't explain the truth away &mdash;
   You can't say, &ldquo;This HAS been, but isn't now."

Now, as for God, HIS way is perfect:   So
   When God is calling, we must all obey;
Yet even God, who says that he must go,
   Knows, in a larger sense, that he must stay.

He will be here in youthful eyes that learned,
   Through his clear sight, more perfectly to see;
In aged forms, whose captive spirits yearned
   To know the Truth &mdash; and found it made them free!

O, you can take away the well-loved face,
   The brilliant mind, in which we placed great stock;
But you cannot dissolve the work of grace
   That binds THIS man forever to THIS flock.

He will be ours, wherever he may roam,
   As seasons change, and wheels of time revolve;
He built himself an everlasting home
   Within our hearts....and that you can't dissolve.</p>

You found the sunspots on the sun.

You saw the mountains on the moon.
And all the moons that travel 'round

So many things, remote and strange:
How Venus' shape would seem to change;
How many million stars unite
To give the Milky Way its light.

A cry that is moving along on wheels,
And gathering volume, to lift and flout
Itself on space, with a mighty shout.

Close in the covert while it goes by;
He knows how the frightened birds will wheel
Over that mass of swaying steel.

He knows it all:   how his own shy heart
Will go stark wild, and his eyes will smart,
His head grow hot, and his hands grow numb &mdash;
But still he must watch the dark thing come.

In years to be he will make a choice
Of girsl he knows, and her patient voice
Will almost suit him &mdash; but never quite.
When time is a huddle of day and night,

And out of the hollow it comes, he'll stand,
A foaming bucket in either hand,
Searching dusk with a wishful glance
For his first &mdash; and maybe &mdash; his last romance.

A girl's heart is a very private place:
   Her first love seldom is the boy next door,
The lanky one with freckles on his face,
   Though he may often think he is. Before

She knows of his existence, there is one
   To whom her heart is given, who will be
Her measure of a man. She knows that none
   Can every be so brave, or wise, as he.

She loves an older man, and all her life
   She keeps a comer of her heart for him;
And even when she is a loving wife,
   If she should hear his name her eyes may brim

With sudden tears. But, try to understand &mdash;

	<p class='poem'>In the carpenter shop of Joseph
There was more than the bright tools made;
Sometimes a Song in the silence,
Or a Light where the young Lad played.

In the home of Mary and Martha
There was more than the guest who came:
Sometimes a Voice in the darkness,
Or out of the shadow, Flame.

In the judgement hall of Pilate
There was more than a man forsooth:
There was a Peace and a Presence&mdash;&mdash;
And the Answer to &ldquo;What is truth?"</p>

	<p class='poem'>She does not sing of beauty now:  her days
Have grown too full of countless ministries.
An alien, down dear remembered ways,
She walks as one who neither hears nor sees
The meadow-lark, the clean slant of the sail,
The vagrant petal drifting with the wind;

No longer lured by every winding trail.
She does not sing of beauty:   But  her touch
Is full of all the beauty she has known,
Light winds, cool raindrops; the fevered clutch
Feebly at her to make her peace their own.
And some there are who miss her songs; but some
Who know she need not sing.......She has become.</p>

   But crowded with confusion and with strife.
Choose wisely, soul:   The  highway to our God
   Leads past the wellspring of eternal life.

The signposts of the world may lead astray,
   The profits that they premise prove but loss;
But he who finds the Life, the Truth, the Way,
   Need only heed the signpost of the Cross.

The highways of the world are all ablaze
   With neon lights. God's highway has but one:
Sufficient light for all earth's nights and days
   The heart can find in God's beloved Son.

And by that Light, down little lanes of love,
   The heart can move to heal the world's distress;
Until at last, in God's great home above,
   We dwell with Him, who is our righteousness.</p>

He builds his structures reaching for the sky.
Above their puny pretense, quite alone,
The timeless mountains stand aloof and high.

Man writes his name in symphony and song,
Along the path where weary mortals plod
He seeks articulation. There remains
More music in the silences of God.

Man flings his feeble flutters into space
And prides himself on progress and on change.
The silent stars, eternities away,
Maintain their secret orbs remote and strange.

Man breaks the alabaster of his heart.
But all the precious ointment, sacrificed
To voice his human love, is lost beside
God's love, unspeakable, in Jesus Christ. </p>

This is dark business, sinister and grim:

    My heart is like a lonely searching bird;
It scans the dark and listens through the night,

	<p class='poem'>It falls....Weep, Heart, but know your tears are vain
The trees' green spring is but a crimson stain:
Long since, the lark his parting song has sung,
The last rose faded; but while yet there clung

One leaf unto the branch the heart could sing -
But now it falls. Weep, Heart, weep for the Spring .
Weep for the promise made.
Weep for the vows unpaid.

Weep for the hopes diminished,
Weep - and when you have finished,
Lean close your tear-stained face to earth and hear,
Sweeter than music falling on the ear,

Her answer: &ldquo;Not a Spring, forgotten, lies
In fallen leaves; for when the last leaf dies,
God's hands most wisely crush it, bit by bit,
Back into dust - and make new Springs of it."

It falls - Weep, Heart, but not a tear avails
To call the lone dream back - the last dream fails:
Laughter and love have left life's laden bough
Long since. With only dreams for comfort, now

The last dream falls - and withers in the grass.
Weep Heart, that beauty fails, that dreams must pass,
Weep for the stricken ways,
Weep for the empty days,

Weep for the doubts that hover,
Weep and, when weeping over.
Lean close and hear your own heart give you back
Wisdom enough to fill lifes' little lack:

&ldquo;No dream is lost: the hope that bade you lift
Your face to dreams is God's unfailing gift.
In other lives and loves the dream endures -
Not less itself because no longer yours."</p>

In such a way, on Spring nights, moves the urge
   To beauty in between
Hedgerows - and breaks, at last, a whitening surge
   Of blossoms on the green -

In such a way, and yet more intimate.
  More dear, the still foam lies,
That is white fragrance by the garden gate.
  And glory in the eyes.

  Of which old dreams are knit,
When, still, a hawthorn hedge can stab my heart

Life will merge into a dreary hovel,

Life will be a house whose every rafter

You will start, at dusk, to hear my laughter

Where two may nibble a -whole life long

And whether they dine on the food of faith

I think how two, to the journey's end,
   Rejoice in this simple fare.

For though they may hunger, little or much
   They know that the meal suffices,
Where love is the daily butter and bread
   And love is the sugar and spices.

I whisper thanks for the table cloth

I have swept down patience,

Of an old gray spider

I have swept ambition

Sweet Innocence, and Faith, and Hope, and Trust,

And over all and compassing the rest,

   On which to lay the gifts I made for you: 
I could not give them now to some one else&mdash;

But there's a quiet place out in the woods,
   Where all night long the sad winds come and play;
There I shall go and dig a little grave
