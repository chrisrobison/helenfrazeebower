I SEA LOVER MAY not sleep as others do when night Lets down the quiet curtain of her dreams Far in the lavish splendor of the light The mad moon squanders from her hoard of beams One waits and all his silence is a prayer A still white prayer that mounts to something higher And bursts at last a full cry on the air The rising flood tide of his young desire It is the sea my lover From afar He comes to deck my beauty moon soft pearls Are flung about my neck a silver star Burns for my hair and lightly he unfurls Fold after fold of gray chiffon mist spun I stoop I yield Beloved I am won Helen Frazee Bower
