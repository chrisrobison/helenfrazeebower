It has been said that a good writer is the person with wide breadth of experiences and a sensitive heart and mind. 
Helen Frazee-Bower, one of America's finest writers of verse, is just such a person. Helen was born in California, 
the daughter of artist and writer Isaac Jenkinsen Frazee. She was the wife of musician William M. Bower and the 
mother of five.  Besides being a noted author, Helen taught in the Los Angeles City School System, was a well-known 
speaker, a Bible teacher and a prolific poet, publishing hundreds of poems in various periodicals. In November, 1955, 
the busy life of the author was interrupted when she was struck by an automobile in a crosswalk in Los Angeles. From 
that time until her death in June, 1960, she was paralyzed from her shoulders down. But her poetry continued with the aid of her husband, 
to whom she dictated her work. A devout woman, her poems and stories have a deeply spiritual nature. Her work has 
appeared in many religious publications, poetry magazines, as well as more popular mainstream magazines such as 
Harper's, Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal, Good Housekeeping and others. She received many awards for her work.
Her sonnet, Retreat, won first prize in the Robert Browning poetry competition in California. 
Her poems have been widely used by ministers, in radio broadcasts and even appear in the US congressional record.
Much of her work has been extensively reprinted and some have been set to music.
